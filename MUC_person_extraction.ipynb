WE HAVE ALREADYADDRESSED THIS ISSUE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, EXPRESSING OUR WILLINGNESSTO HOLD A MEETING.  THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION\\'S LETTER MAKES NO MENTIONOF ANY MOVE TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS.  IT DOES NOT EVEN CONSIDERINCLUDING THIS TOPIC ON THE MEETING\\'S AGENDA.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT ISCLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON19 MARCH.   CONSEQUENTLY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]HEREBY INFORMS THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE OFTHE FOLLOWING:   1. THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNCETHAT IT IS WILLING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON CONFINING THE ARMY TO ITSBARRACKS ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTIONS, ESTABLISHING AN ELECTORAL CODEBY CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ABSENTEE VOTING FOR SALVADORANS LIVING ABROAD,RESTRUCTURING THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS COUNCIL, AND FORMING A COUNCIL FORVERIFICATION.   MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST EXPRESS THE STATE POWERS\\' WILLINGNESS TOPOSTPONE THE ELECTIONS FOR 5 MONTHS, ONCE A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN AGREEDUPON.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST PUBLICLYANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO BRING MILITARY COMMANDERS AND OFFICERSRESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL MURDERS AND CRIMES TO TRIAL, TO REDUCE THESALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TO THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IT HAD IN 1968, AND TODISBAND THE SECURITY FORCES TO FORM A NEW CIVIL POLICE.  WE REITERATEOUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PERMANENTLY CEASING THE ARMED STRUGGLE.   2. IF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AGREES TO THE ABOVE REQUESTS, THEFMLN WILL AGREE TO A MEETING AND IS WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY DECIDE ON ADATE AND A TIME FOR THE MEETING.  THE FMLN IS EVEN WILLING TO HOLD THEMEETING OUTSIDE EL SALVADOR.  AS A PART OF THIS MEETING, WE ARE WILLINGTO NEGOTIATE AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES STAFF ON ACEASE-FIRE THAT WILL BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONTO THE CONFLICT.   3. IF NO SUCH AGREEMENT IS REACHED, THEN THERE IS NO POINT INHOLDING THE MEETING PRIOR TO 19 MARCH, BECAUSE IT WILL SIMPLY BE USEDBY BOTH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND THE NATIONALISTREPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] IN THEIR ELECTION DISPUTE.  THE ELECTIONSPLAY NO ROLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE; THEY ONLY SERVE TO PROVIDE A FALSEJUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING THE WAR.   4. WE AWAIT A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION.

IT HAS BEEN AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO USE THE TREATY EXCLUSIVELY TOSOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION; THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHEN WE REFERTO ITS PARTIAL USE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] SO AS FOR THE COMPENSATIONSUBJECT, IT WILL BE USED.  WE ARE USING THE MECHANISM CREATED BY THEFIVE-MEMBER COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY. THE LANGUAGE OF THISTREATY WAS PERTINENT FOR THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY BUT IS NOLONGER IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES.  [ENDRECORDING]   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ARGENTINE AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS,VARGAS CARRENO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM WILL VISITCHILE IN AUGUST IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION FROM CHILEAN PRESIDENTPATRICIO AYLWIN, WHO WILL ALSO VISIT ARGENTINA AT AN AS YETUNDETERMINED DATE.   VARGAS CARRENO NOTED HIS SATISFACTION WITH HIS MEETINGS IN BUENOSAIRES WITH FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND RAUL CARIGNANO, UNDERSECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS.  VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT AS ARESULT OF THIS INITIAL CONTACT THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHEDBY THE CHILEAN-ARGENTINE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY, WHICH WAS SIGNEDIN 1984, WILL MEET NEXT JULY.  HE SAID THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES WILLCONTINUE TO HOLD FORMAL AND INFORMAL TALKS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OFCOMMON INTEREST, SPEED UP THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AND INCREASE MUTUALUNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.   REGARDING THE SITUATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILEANCITIZENS LIVING IN ARGENTINA -- A TOTAL HE ESTIMATED AT 800,000 --VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT PRESIDENT AYLWIN\\'S GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHEDAN OFFICE TO HELP THOSE CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD FOR VARIOUS REASONS TORETURN TO CHILE, ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN ARGENTINA\\'S PATAGONIAREGION WHO ARE BEING TREATED INHUMANELY, ESPECIALLY BY BUSINESSMEN INTHE BORDER AREA, AS REPORTED BY AN ARGENTINE JOURNALIST.  TST1-MUC3-0012   SAN SALVADOR, 21 NOV 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] LEFTIST GUERRILLAS EARLYTUESDAY ATTACKED A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADORWHERE MANY GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS HAVE THEIR HOMES.   THE DIN OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS COULD BE HEARD BEFORE DAWN IN THEESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE SHERATON HOTEL.   IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FARABUNDO MARTI [NATIONALLIBERATION FRONT] (FMLN) LAUNCHED THEIR OFFENSIVE 11 DAYS GO THATFIGHTING HAD SPREAD TO THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS AT THE FOOTOF THE SAN SALVADOR VOLCANO.   AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS FLEW OVER THE AREA AND THE SOUND OFMACHINEGUN FIRE COULD BE HEARD.TST1-MUC3-0013   LIMA, 20 DEC 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPT] THE EXECUTIVEBRANCH HAS CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS FOR TOMORROW AND THENEXT DAY TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS SITUATION OF PANAMA AND TO DENOUNCETHE INTER-AMERICAN RECIPROCAL ASSISTANCE TREATY, TIAR, FOR ITSINEFFECTIVENESS.  THIS WAS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AT THECONCLUSION OF A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING AT GOVERNMENT HOUSETODAY.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE OVER THE MILDNESSWITH WHICH THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE REACTED TOTHE U.S. AGGRESSION AGAINST PANAMA.  PRESIDENT GARCIA ALSO SAID THATTHE FUEL PRICE INCREASE WILL ALLOW PETROPERU [STATE PETROLEUM AGENCY]TO OPERATE.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] WHAT IMPORTANT SUBJECTSWERE DISCUSSED IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TODAY?   [GARCIA] THE MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO CALL A SPECIALCONGRESSIONAL SESSION ON 22 AND 23 DECEMBER TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUSSITUATION CREATED BY THE U.S. INVASION IN PANAMA.  THE SECONDIMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARYORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THEUNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BEABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL.   THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.  ACCORDING TO THETIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DIDEXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM.   NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE.RATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.  THEREFORE,SINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS AREPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT.  WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THETIAR.  THIS MUST BE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVECALLED A SPECIAL SESSION.   [REPORTER] SEVERAL SECTORS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DECISION TO WITHDRAWTHE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AS A HASTY DECISION.WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT THOSE MUST BE SECTORS COMMITTED TO THEINVASION.  THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITEDSTATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDEWHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT.   AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE ANDBLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION.THERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIANTERRITORY.  THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEWGOVERNMENT.  THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG ASTHIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOTSTAY IN THAT COUNTRY.  THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; ITREPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE.   AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILLKEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE.  AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOTWITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN ANDPERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER.   [REPORTER] DON\\'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAINRELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN\\'T IT JEOPARDIZE THEIMF LOAN?   [GARCIA] NOT AT ALL.  THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS.THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONALPOLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC ANDMILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE.   BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.  AS FORPANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAINACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WHEN ELECTIONS TOOKPLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATESDECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGEFRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACENICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER.  THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITOWERE THE AMERICANS.  ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA.   IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HISPLACE.  THE AMERICANS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DEL VALLE AS PRESIDENT.THEREFORE, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NORIEGA\\'S ACCOMPLICE INDEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WE DENOUNCED THIS.  NORIEGA IS ACREATION OF THE UNITED STATES.  IT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN SAID THATNORIEGA WORKED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THE U.S.  CENTRALINTELLIGENCE AGENCY, WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS ONCE CHIEF.   THEREFORE, NOW THAT THE MAID IS ANSWERING BACK, MAKING CLAIMS TOTHE PANAMA CANAL AND WANTING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM THE UNITEDSTATES, THE UNITED STATES SUDDENLY DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS A DRUGTRAFFICKER AND THAT SHE DOES NOT SERVE ITS INTERESTS, SO THEY SEND30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS TO PANAMA.  THIS IS AN ABUSE.  IT IS A VIOLATIONOF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANOTHER STATE.   NO HONORABLE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY SHOULD TOLERATE THIS INVASIONWITHOUT ACTIVELY AND OPENLY CONDEMNING IT.  ONE WAY TO CONDEMN IT ANDEXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OF IT IS TO SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE TROOPSINVADING LATIN AMERICA REMAIN, WE DO NOT NEED TO MAINTAIN OURAMBASSADOR THERE.

THEY CANNOT CONTINUE CLOSING THEIR EYES TO THE BOMBINGS, TO THETHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF SANSALVADOR, TO THE MOTHERS WHO APPEAR CRYING ON TELEVISION.  IT IS GOODTHAT THE NETWORK PRESENTS THESE PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRYING,MANIPULATING THEIR EMOTIONS.  THOSE TEARS WERE SHED OVER 50 YEARS OFOPPRESSION AND MISERY, AND OVER THE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE DESTROYEDZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  OFFICERS, THE BOMBS HAVE CAUSED ALL THAT SORROWAND THE DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOUSES IN ZACAMIL.   AS WE WERE SAYING, OFFICERS, YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES: WHO ARE YOUDYING FOR?  FOR COLONEL PONCE\\'S MANSIONS IN MIAMI?  FOR GENERALBUSTILLO\\'S MANSIONS?  WHY ARE THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS DYING HERE?WHY ARE THE LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPITAINS DYING, WHILE THE MEMBERS OF THEARMED FORCES HIERARCHY ARE CONFORTABLY SITTING IN THEIRAIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES BEING GUARDED WHILE THEY ARE AT EASE, BUT NOTREALLY AT EASE AS COMBAT IS TAKING PLACE JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THEIROFFICE.   OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS, CAPTAINS, THIS IS THE APPEAL THE FMLN WANTSMAKE TO YOU TODAY, AT A TIME WHEN THE FUTURE OF THE FATHERLAND IS ATSTAKE?  YOU MUST THINK THIS OVER, YOU MUST MAKE A DECISION, AND YOUMUST DO THIS SOON.  HISTORY IS MOVING FAST, AND THE TIME IS RIPE. SOWHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUTWHAT WE ARE TELLING YOU.  IF YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINKABOUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING.  IF WE ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION HERE,WHY IS THIS CONSTITUTION BEING VIOLATED BY THOSE RAMBOS SENT BYPRESIDENT BUSH TO EL SALVADOR?  YOU ALL KNOW THIS LITTLE GROUP OFRAMBOS IS GOOD FOR NOTHING, AS THEY ARE COWARDS.  THEY DID NOT WANT TOLEAVE THE SHERATON HOTEL, BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS WERE THERE.  THEY ARECOWARDS, JUST LIKE THEIR SYSTEM.  THEY ARE TINHORN RAMBOS, WHO AREABSOLUTELY NO GOOD.   AS WE SAID YESTERDAY, IF THOSE MEN WHO LEFT THE SHERATON LIKECOMMON CRIMINALS COVERING THEIR FACES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS ARETHE ONES WHO ARE TRAINING THE ARMED FORCES, WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTERWHY THE FMLN IS DEFEATING THE TACTICS TAUGHT BY THEM.  THEY ARE NOGOOD, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR PEOPLE, THEY UNDERESTIMATEOUR PEOPLE.  OFFICERS, YOU KNOW THOSE U.S.  ADVISERS UNDERESTIMATEYOU, THEY LOOK DOWN ON YOU, AS LITTLE INDIANS, AS DONKEYS.  YOU KNOWHOW THEY THINK OF YOU.  YOU KOW THEY MOCK THE SALVADORAN OFFICERS.OFFICERS, YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW THESE U.S.  ADVISERS TREAT OURSOLDIERS.  THEY ARE HAUGHTY, ARROGANT, AND COWARDS.  YOU SAW THEM ATTHE SHERATON HOTEL, PISSING IN THEIR PANTS, THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVETHE HOTEL.  A COMMISSION WENT THERE, THE RED CROSS WENT THERE, BUTTHEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THEMSELVESDURING THE TRUCE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE COWARDS.   WE WANT THE CIN [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER], THAT FASCISTNETWORK THAT IS SILENCING OUR PEOPLE, TO PRESENT THE FILMS OF THEADVISORS LEAVING THE HOTEL.  WE CHALLENGE THE NETWORK TO PRESENT THOSEFILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE SHERATON, WITH THEIR FACES COVEREDAS IF THEY WERE CAR THIEVES.  THAT IS THE WAY THE U.S.  ADVISERS --THE RAMBOS, THE SUPERMEN -- LEFT THE SHERATON.  THESE RAMBOS ARE NOTGOING TO SAVE ANYONE, AS THEY CANNOT EVEN SAVE THEMSELVES.

OQUELI, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) ANDHILDA FLORES, A GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER WERE ABDUCTED ANDKILLED IN JANUARY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN GUATEMALA CITY ASTHEY WERE HEADING TO THE LA AURORA AIRPORT.

ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTHDELEGATIONS SEPARATELY.

SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT \"SALVADORAN RIGHTISTSECTORS AND SOLDIERS\" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMYSPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT.

THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THEONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS\\' MURDER CASE COULD BECLEARED-UP.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION [ARMEDFORCES] THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITSMEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FORPOLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THEARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THATOUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLEPASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEENON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HADTO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVEHAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. [END RECORDING]   D\\'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEENCLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THECONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] THE JESUITS\\' CASE WAS A DETERMININGFACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OFTHE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THISIS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOTBELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLYAFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTINATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  FOR ARGUMENT\\'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DIDARISE [WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED], THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  IKNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLEDISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THENEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELYCAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUMOF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARETHINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERETHEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. [END RECORDING]   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEENPRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSAGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THEMILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS\\' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHINTHE PARTY.  D\\'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVERBEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WEARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THEMAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.  THIS IS REASON FORPRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTYAND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]   IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D\\'AUBUISSON SUPPORTEDPRESIDENT CRITIANI\\'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UNSECRETARY GENERAL.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TOACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVINGRESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTSMADE. [END RECORDING]   MAJ ROBERTO D\\'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THISYEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TOGET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  HE WILLMOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD,BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATETHEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.TST1-MUC3-0020   SAN SALVADOR, 11 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] THE ARMEDFORCES HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

CRISTIANI HAS SIGNED OFF ON THE CONTRAS\\' DEATH AND ACKNOWLEDGEDBEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE FMLN IS A FORCE WITH WHICH IT MUSTTALK AND NEGOTIATE.  HE WENT TO TELA WITH A DIALOGUE PLAN TO COVER UPTHE WAR, BUT HE WAS FORCED, UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, TO NEGOTIATE FORPEACE WITH THE FMLN.  CRISTIANI\\'S DIALOGUE COMMISSION, IN FACT, HASBEEN DEMOBILIZED.   5. CRISTIANI WAS FORCED TO SIGN A PLEDGE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION WHENHIS PLANS WAS TO FASCISTIZE EL SALVADOR.   6. THE FMLN REAFFIRMS ITS RESOLVE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEEFFORTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOPRIC, ANDOTHER SOCIAL FORCES TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEGOVERNMENT.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTRAS WERE A MERCENARY FORCEMAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ATTACKED NICARAGUA FROMHONDURAS, AND WHICH SHOULD AND COULD BE DEMOBILIZED.  IT IS CLEAR THATTHE FMLN IS A NATIONAL FORCE THAT HAS REASONS FOR BEING AT WAR, ANDWITH WHICH PEACE MUST BE NEGOTIATED.  NO ONE CAN DEMOBILIZE THE FMLNBECAUSE IT IS WITHIN THE COUNTRY AND IS A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL FORCE.   THE FMLN CALLS ON ALL FELLOW PATRIOTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE INHONDURAS, NICARAGUA, COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, AND THE REST OF THE WORLDTO RETURN TO THE FATHERLAND.  THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THE TELAAGREEMENTS.  WE ASK ALL SALVADORANS TO DEMAND OF CRISTIANI THAT,WITHOUT FURTHER STRATAGEMS, HE CARRY OUT A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION;FULFILL HIS PLEDGE TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY; STOP THE REPRESSION,KIDNAPPING, AND TORTURE; RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; GUARANTEEFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; RESPECT REFORM; AND ABOLISH THE ECONOMICMEASURES THAT ARE DEEPENING THE WAR.

TODAYBOTH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMEDTHE CRASH, BUT THEY REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THE AMERICANS WHOWERE KILLED WERE CIA OFFICIALS, OR ON THE NATURE OF THE PLANE\\'SMISSION.  THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE RESPONSE THAT THE U.S.GOVERNMENT MADE A FEW DAYS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH A PLANE CRASH IN ELSALVADOR.   AFTER A PLANE CARRYING WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS CRASHEDON 25 NOVEMBER, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED THEUNDERSECRETARY OF STATE ON THAT SAME EVENING TO SUMMON THE SOVIETAMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES TO PROTEST TO THE SOVIET UNION FORUNDERMINING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND \"FAILING TO EXERCISE ITSINFLUENCE\" TO STOP CUBA AND NICARAGUA FROM DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THEGUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.  IN THIS CONNECTION, A U.S.  GOVERNMENTOFFICIAL POINTED OUT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD PRESENT THE CENTRALAMERICA ISSUE AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHILE DISCUSSING PROBLEMS OFREGIONAL CONFLICTS WITH SOVIET LEADERS DURING THEIR MEDITERRANEANMEETING.  SOME OFFICIALS EVEN SAID THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE ISTHE \"PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE\" TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS,AND THAT ONLY WHEN THE USSR MAKES FURTHER CONCESSIONS ON THE CENTRALAMERICA ISSUE WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDEECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE SOVIET UNION.   IN A CEASEFIRE ACCORD SIGNED ON 24 JUNE THIS YEAR, UNITA AND THEANGOLAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO SEEK WAYS AND MEANS TO CONCLUDE THE CIVILWAR THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 14 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE U.S.  GOVERNMENTKEEPS SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA.  ACCORDING TO U.S.  NEWSPAPERS, EVERSINCE THE SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES STOPPED SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITALAST APRIL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME UNITA\\'S MAIN WEAPON SUPPLIER.THE SECRET THAT THE UNITED STATES\\' MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UNITAINCREASED FROM $15 MILLION TO $50 MILLION THIS YEAR WAS REVEALED AFTERTHE CRASH OF THE CIA\\'S WEAPON CARRIER.  NOW, EVEN THE U.S. PRESS HASASKED THIS QUESTION: COULD IT PREVENT PRESIDENT BUSH FROM PRESENTINGHIS CRITICISM WHEN PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE DISCUSSED WHENHE MEETS THE SOVIET LEADER?  A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID:\"NOT AT ALL,\" \"WE WILL NOT PLACE (THE TWO) ON A PAR.\"  A STATEDEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUETO PROVIDE \"APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\" TO UNITA IN THEFUTURE.TST1-MUC3-0030   NO CITY (PERU), 16 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] AS A LATINAMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THESTATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCEDIN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FORPRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET\\'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM.THAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTERFROM ONLY ONE SIDE.  OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVERIS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLEFOR THEM.  THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY.  ASPRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGEREGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHOMUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES.   WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHEDTHESE CONCLUSIONS.  WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEENHANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOSGALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED ANOFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERERESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THENEXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE.  THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THEWORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OFAIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OFDOLLARS TO COLOMBIA.  AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLYHELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIANGOVERNMENT, WERE SENT.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSEHELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU.   I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORTPRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY.  IF HE HAS THAT MUCHCONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OFWHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TOREPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATINAMERICA.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITHPRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS.  THEN, ASPRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME.  BUT THEMEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTALINTEREST IN THE FUTURE.   [CORRESPONDENT] WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEARFUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND AREPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC?   [GARCIA] YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM.CARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECTDEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT.  THOSE MONOPOLIESMIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THISGROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE ITWAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIALMILITARY REGIME.  IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITYOF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES,WHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY AMATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OFOUR SOCIAL LIFE.  I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREEPRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S.  PRESIDENT KNOW OURVIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM.   [CORRESPONDENT] WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT?   [GARCIA] I DON\\'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE.  THE IDEA EMERGEDIN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITHPRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.   [CORRESPONDENT] A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THISMONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT?   [GARCIA] NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS.FOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIPABROAD.  I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITHPRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY1990.   [CORRESPONDENT] CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEENSAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERUFROM THE IMF.  WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSIONMEAN?   [GARCIA] WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BEEXPELLED FROM THE IMF.  SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISMREGARDING THE MATTER.  WHAT IS THE IMF?  IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITORBANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITHBALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIRFOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS.  WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100MILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FORIMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS.  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TOFACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  AN IMFCREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENTPROGRAM.  ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY\\'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTIONSO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY\\'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBTOBLIGATIONS.

THE MANEUVERS, DESIGNED TO TEACH THEARGENTINE OFFICERS THE LATEST TECHNIQUES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,FALL WITHIN THE COMPREHENSIVE MILITARY EXCHANGE PLAN.  GENERAL MAXWELLTHURMAN\\'S VISIT IS ALSO PART OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PLAN.   ACCORDING TO RELIABLE SOURCES, THE RECENT VISIT FROM THE UNITEDSTATES OF 10 LIEUTENANT COLONELS, THREE COLONELS, AND EIGHT CIVILIANEXPERTS IN DEFENSE STRATEGY, REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THERENEWED U.S.-ARGENTINE MILITARY RELATIONSHIP.   THE SAME SOURCES HAVE STATED THAT THE GRADUAL AND RESTRICTEDPARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY IN MANEUVERS DESIGNED TO PRACTICE FIGHTINGAGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRYAND EVEN BY THE PRESIDENT.   THE MILITARY GROUP THAT ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA ON 6 MAY CARRIED OUTWAR GAMES AT THE WAR SCHOOL AND THE CAMPO DE MAYO MILITARY SCHOOL AND,LATER ON, CARRIED OUT FIELD MANEUVERS. OTHER FORCES PARTICIPATED INTHE THREE-DAY MANEUVERS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT ON AN ISLAND IN THERIVER PLATE DELTA. ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THE MANEUVERS CONSISTED OF\"RAIDS\" INCLUDING \"SURPRISE\" SITUATIONS THAT FORCED THE U.S. TROOPS TOENDURE BAD WEATHER AND BAD TERRAIN.   ACCORDING TO THE FINAL EVALUATION, THE MANEUVERS WERE REGARDED AS\"SATISFACTORY AND SUCCESSFUL\".  ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM, A COMPLETEU.S. COMPANY THAT WILL TRAIN WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A PROVINCE OFTHE LITTORAL REGION IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN JUNE.   FOREIGN MINISTRY SOURCES CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF EXCHANGE PLANSBUT STATED THAT GENERAL THURMAN HAD PROPOSED TO THE CHIEFS OF STAFFTHE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT JOINT MANEUVERS TO FIGHT DRUGTRAFFICKING DURING A LUNCHEON.   THE SOURCES STATED THAT THE CHIEFS OF STAFF HAVE MADE SOMEOBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL AND DID NOT REACH ANY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER,SOURCES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT MANEUVERS ON THE ISLAND HAD ADIFFERENT OPINION AND RATIFIED THAT ANOTHER MANEUVER WOULD BE HELD INA PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL IN JUNE.   ANYHOW, THE STATEMENT OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN FALLSWITHIN THE DIPLOMATIC POLICY THAT MAY PARTLY DIFFER WITH THE MILITARYAND DEFENSE POLICIES, AS WAS POINTED OUT BY A SECTOR OF THE MEDIAYESTERDAY.   MOREOVER, GENERAL THURMAN WILL REMAIN IN SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHEUNTIL SATURDAY, 19 MAY, AND THAT SAME DAY WILL FLY TO THE IGUAZU FALLSFROM WHERE HE WILL RETURN TO HIS MILITARY BASE IN PANAMA.   THE ONLY PURPOSE OF GENERAL THURMAN\\'S VISIT WAS TO OFFER THEDEFENSE MINISTRY ALL THE TECHNOLOGY, KNOW HOW, AND WEAPONS FOR THESTRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, IN MANY CASES TURNS INTONARCOTERRORISM, IN OTHER WORDS, THE USE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING TO FINANCETHE PURCHASE OF WEAPONS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS. THURMAN\\'S VISIT, WHICHTOOK THE UNITED STATES A WHOLE YEAR TO ARRANGE, WAS PREVIOUSLYAPPROVED BY THE U.S. SENATE.   WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE HAVE JUST RECEIVEDWEAPONS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AMOUNTING TO $50 MILLION, WHICH IS ENOUGHTO EQUIP TWO COMPLETE BATTALIONS IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUGTRAFFICKERS.   THEREFORE, THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT\\'S DECISION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THESTRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING LAUNCHED BY THE UNITED STATES ISPART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY OF THE SOUTHERN CONE OF WHICHARGENTINA -- ACCORDING TO EXPERTS -- MUST PARTICIPATE OUT OF FEAR OF AGROWING ISOLATION.   IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THE RESTRICTED AND GRADUAL -- BY NO MEANSMASSIVE -- PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY AND PROBABLY THE NAVY INMANEUVERS FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MAY BE THE KEYTHAT WILL FINALLY ALLOW THE ARMED FORCES TO ACQUIRE THE WAR MATERIEL,SPARE PARTS AND OTHER ELEMENTS IT NEEDS.   THE ANALYSTS HAVE RECALLED THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\\'S DETERMINATIONTO FIGHT CORRUPTION -- A PROBLEM THAT ALSO WORRIES PRESIDENT CARLOSMENEM AND VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO DUHALDE -- FALLS WITHIN THE SAMEFRAMEWORK BECAUSE, IN THE EXPERTS\\' OPINION, IT IS THE EQUIVALENT TODRUG TRAFFICKING.   HIGHLY RELIABLE SOURCES HAVE RECALLED THAT 30 DAYS AGO PRESIDENTGEORGE BUSH SENT PRESIDENT MENEM TWO VOLUMES OF A U.S. EDITION ONTECHNIQUES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.

THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE ATTACKED THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADORWITH MACHINEGUN FIRE AND ROCKETS JUST AS PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REJECTEDTHE DIALOGUE PROPOSAL MADE BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 22 NOVEMBER.

THE PRESIDENT, ACCOMPANIED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OFSTAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES, SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE FMLNPROPOSAL \"IS NOT VERY SERIOUS\" BECAUSE \"IT IS NOT AIMED AT THEGOVERNMENT BUT AT THE ARMY, WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT,\" HE SAID.

IF THEY WANT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEY SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIRWEAPONS AND PEACEFULLY JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS,\" CRISTIANI SAID.   THE PRESIDENT WARNED THAT \"THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES AREWILLING TO FIGHT MILITARILY. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE FMLNCONTINUES TO BEHAVE THIS WAY, NOT LISTENING TO REASON, AND NOT ENDINGTHIS MADNESS,\" THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID.   THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD WITH SOME 50 JOURNALISTS, WAS ABRUPTLYINTERRUPTED BY THE HEAVY BOMBINGS CARRIED OUT BY THE SALVADORAN AIRFORCE AGAINST ALLEGED GUERRILLA COLUMNS.   FOLLOWING THE FIRST BOMBINGS, WHICH ROCKED THE MILITARY OFFICESWHERE THE NEWS CONFERENCE WAS BEING HELD, CRISTIANI AND PONCE RESUMEDCONTROL OF THE CONFERENCE AND EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACK WAS THE RESULTOF AN OPERATION IN PURSUIT OF THE \"GUERRILLAS FLEEING IN DISARRAY.\"   THE AIR FORCE BOMBING BEGAN SHORTLY BEFORE THE CURFEW, WHICH BEGANAT 1800 (0000 GMT) UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING (1200 GMT), JUST WHENTHOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WERE RETURNING HOME.   THE HEAVY EXPLOSIONS CAUSED ALARM AMONG THE POPULATION IN NORTHERNSAN SALVADOR AND IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN HURT.   ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE \"HAS BEEN AFAILURE\" NOT ONLY MILITARILY, BUT POLITICALLY AS WELL BECAUSE THEYWERE UNABLE TO INCITE THE PEOPLE TO REBELLION, AS THEY PLANNED.   THE PROPOSAL SIGNED BY THE TOP FIVE FMLN COMMANDERS AND READ ON THEOFFICIAL REBEL STATION, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, HAS BEENRELEASED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A REBEL MILITARY OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN12 DAYS AGO AND WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE DEAD, HUNDREDSOF PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.TST1-MUC3-0035   CLANDESTINE, 26 MAY 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] PLEASE PAYCLOSE ATTENTION.

AT 0700, THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMBUSH IN WHICH SIXARMORED VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED.  THE AMBUSH WAS STAGED AGAINSTATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS IN CUSCATANCINGO WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TOREINFORCE ENEMY POSITIONS UNDER ATTACK IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THECAPITAL.  OUR FORCES USED ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND SMALL ARMS FIRE, ASWELL AS EXPLOSIVES, TO AMBUSH THIS CONVOY, DESTROYING SIX ARMOREDVEHICLES.   IN ADDITION, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION [FMLN] FIGHTERSATTACKED BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  THE BELLOSOBATTALION CALLED FOR AIR SUPPORT, WHICH IT RECEIVED, BUT THIS HASRESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BECAUSE THE HELICOPTERS USED HAVEBEEN BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AYUTUXTEPEQUEAREA.  THE DESPERATE AIR SUPPORT HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIANVICTIMS.   MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES BEGAN ATTACKING ENEMY POSITIONS IN LOSSANTOS, BOSQUES DEL RIO, AND UNICENTRO, IN SOYAPANGO.   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT BARRICADES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BUILT INTHE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR\\'S NORTHERN ANDSOUTHERN SECTORS.  THESE ARE BARRICADES BUILT BY YOUTHS, STUDENTS,WORKERS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO HELPWITH FOOD AND INFORMATION AND WHO, WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, ARE BUILDINGBARRICADES AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF THE VANGUARD:  THE FMLN.   WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT THE FIGHTING WHICHHAD DECREASED IN THE UNIVERSITY AREA RESUMED AT 0600 THIS MORNING.TST1-MUC3-0042   TEGUCIGALPA, 20 DEC 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY][TEXT] FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA ISLAND, THE WORLDDISCARDED ANY FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF A U.S.  ARMED OPERATION AGAINSTANOTHER NATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, DESPITE THE DETERIORATION OFITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE U.S.GOVERNMENT.  IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE U.S.  WOULD CONFINE ITSPARTICIPATION TO SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING MOVEMENTS AIMED AT OUSTINGGOVERNMENTS OR, AS IN THE CASE OF NICARAGUA, OF SUPPORTING REBELFORCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET BY THE WHITE HOUSE.   THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN PANAMA HAVESURPRISED THE WORLD BECAUSE, DESPITE GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA\\'SCHALLENGING ATTITUDE, NO ONE THOUGHT THE U.S. WOULD INVADE PANAMA.NORIEGA WAS CERTAIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT DO SO, AND SUPPOSEDTHAT U.S. ATTITUDES AGAINST HIM WOULD CONSIST OF SPONSORING REBELLION,SUCH AS THE RECENT 3-OCTOBER ATTEMPT, WHEN THE U.S.  GOVERNMENTENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES TO REBEL AGAINSTTHEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  NORIEGA NEVER THOUGHT THE U.S. GOVERNMENTWOULD EVER CONDUCT A MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST PANAMA, ALTHOUGH THEREWERE U.S. TROOPS BASED ON THE CANAL ZONE.  HE CONTINUED UNDER THISIMPRESSION BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THESE TROOPS CHANGED FROM THEIRROLE OF SURVEILLANCE, NOT EVEN WHEN WASHINGTON PROMOTED THE REBELLIONOF SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE PANAMANIAN FORCES.   THIS EXCESSIVE SECURITY DISTRACTED NORIEGA AND ENCOURAGED HIM TOCHALLENGE THE U.S. POLICIES.  NORIEGA DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S.THREATS AND HE ADOPTED AN OMNIPOTENT STANCE, LIKE HIS RECENT DECISIONTO APPOINT HIMSELF THE SUPREME LEADER OF PANAMA.  NORIEGA BELIEVEDTHAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION IN HISCOUNTRY, AND THAT THE U.S. DECISION TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITIONCURRENTLY IN EXILE WOULD PRODUCE MOVEMENTS AGAINST HIS REGIME, OR THATA COMMANDO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THIS BELIEF,HE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND EQUIPPED MANYCIVILIANS WHO SUPPORTED HIM WITH WEAPONS TO BE READY TO DISMANTLEMOVEMENTS THAT TRIED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT.   AS THE CLOCKS STRUCK MIDNIGHT IN PANAMA, THE U.S. FORCES BEGAN ANOPERATION AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCE BARRACKS.  THE TROOPSALREADY BASED IN PANAMA, AND THOSE FLOWN IN FROM BASES IN CALIFORNIAAND IN OTHER CITIES NEAR PANAMA, STARTED A MASSIVE ATTACK TO OUST GENNORIEGA.   THE INVASION, WHICH SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SOME AND TO OTHERS [WORDSINDISTINCT], WERE MAINLY CONDUCTED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEENDECLARED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BYTHE U.S. COURTS.   EARLY THIS MORNING, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THATTHE OPERATION WAS AIMED AT CAPTURING NORIEGA AND TAKING HIM TO THEUNITED STATES TO BE TRIED FOR THE CRIMES ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE U.S.COURTS, AT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TREATIES ON THE PANAMA CANAL,AND AT RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FARCICALMAY-L989 ELECTIONS.   THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN PANAMA,WHICH IS FILLING THE WORLD WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE DANGER HOVERINGOVER THE CONTINENT AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH\\'S DECISION HASGONE BEYOND THE LOGIC OF THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA.   INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DID, HOWEVER, GUESS THAT SOMETHING WASABOUT TO OCCUR WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID RECENTLY THAT WHILE THE U.S.GOVERNMENT COULD REACH AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA, WITH NORIEGA IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD TODO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VEILED DANGER THAT THREATENED THE AMERICANCONTINENT.   TODAY, PANAMA HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD.  THE CAPITAL AND OTHERCITIES ARE BATTLEFIELDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FIGHTINGTHE U.S. UNITS IN GROUND, AIR, AND MARITIME OPERATIONS THAT SEEK TOOUST MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.   THE U.S. ACTION IS FOCUSSING THE WORLD\\'S ATTENTION ON WASHINGTON\\'SDECISION.  MANY NATIONS WILL PROTEST AND REJECT THE U.S. INVASIONWHICH WAS DISGUISED BY A SERIES OF PEACE-SEEKING ACTIONS.   FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE, THE GHOST OF WAR IS HAUNTING OURCONTINENT.  WE MUST PONDER ON THE NEED TO KEEP HONDURAS ON THEDEMOCRATIC PATH, AND TO AVOID THE ANARCHY THAT DESTROYS NATIONS ANDDECIMATES PEOPLES.  THE EVENTS THAT HAVE KEPT THE WORLD IN VIGIL SINCEMIDNIGHT WILL CONTINUE FOR HOURS, DAYS, OR MAYBE WEEKS BECAUSE, SOFAR, THE NEWS IS VERY CONFUSING AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS ARE DYING ON THESTREETS OF THE PANAMANIAN TOWNS.

WE WILL NOWLISTEN TO COL OCHOA, WHO WILL MAKE KNOWN HIS STAND SINCE THE ARMEDFORCES\\' STATEMENT WAS RELEASED.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] GOOD MORNING, COLONEL.   [OCHOA] GOOD MORNING. THANKS, RAUL.  THESE GENTLEMEN SEEM TO BESPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES.  I KNOW WELL WHAT WASDISCUSSED IN THE MEETING. SOMEONE EVEN SAID THAT THE BRIGHT IDEA OFDISCHARGING ME WAS CONSIDERED.  THEY FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT,HOWEVER, THAT I AM A DEPUTY AND THAT, AS A DEPUTY AND A CITIZEN, I AMENTITLED TO EXPRESS WHAT I FEEL, JUST AS I HAVE DONE.  I, WHO OWEEVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS ASMONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN INTHE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OFTHEM, OF COURSE.  THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM.   I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUTTHE ARMED FORCES\\' SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES.  I SIMPLYDEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOTCONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY ASINGLE PERSON.  I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THEINSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH.  I ONLY HAVE RESPECT ANDLOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATIONTO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOMENEFARIOUS MEMBERS.  I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD,WHO FIGHT EVERY DAY.  OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVEPROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, ASIF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THEINSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE.  QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  MYCRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATIONAND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION.  I WOULD LIKE THEM TOSTOP MAKING RIDICULOUS DEMANDS AND TO STOP SEEKING A CONFRONTATION.IT IS KNOWN THAT WHAT I AM DEMANDING IS WHAT IS BEING FELT AND SAID.I AM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE IN PARTICULAR.  I AM ONLY DEMANDING JUSTICE.COMMANDERS\\' MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT.THEY SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD SHOWN THEIR CONCERN OVER THE ARMED FORCES\\'SITUATION.  I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM TAKE THESTAND TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO THE LAST CONSEQUENCES.  AS THEMILITARY MAN I AM, I ONLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONEDANY NAMES, BUT INSISTED THAT A DEEPER INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO CARRYOUT JUSTICE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS THE INSTITUTION THAT WILL SUFFER.   [REPORTER] COL OCHOA, AFTER THE \"SIXTY MINUTES\" PROGRAM ON CBS INTHE UNITED STATES, IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRYYOUR REMARKS AND YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JESUITS\\' CASE WEREDISTORTED.  TODAY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCUSE YOU. IT HAS BEENSAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THERESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THEINVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS\\' CASE.  DO YOU THINK THERE HASBEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKEADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION?   [OCHOA] I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF ICOULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  A REDUCTIONIN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHSBECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED.  I THINK IT ISRIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULTOF MY REMARKS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMEDFORCES\\' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED.MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OFOPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES\\' CONSTITUTIONALMISSION.  HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BEPROTECTED.   I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IFTO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT HASENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SANSEBASTIAN PEOPLE.  I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES.ONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY.  THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERYWAR.  I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADECOMMANDER IN CABANAS.  I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THEPOPULATION TO HELP THEM.  I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THEARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MYMEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OFTHE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES.  TO POINT THESE THINGS OUTIS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSEI LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS.  THE ARMEDFORCES CAN THUS BE SPARED GREATER DAMAGE BY THE POOR ACTIONS OF SOMEOF ITS MEMBERS.

TST1-MUC3-0046   SAN SALVADOR, 6 JUL 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] THE FARABUNDOMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW HOURSAGO DENYING THAT IT DIRECTED AN ATTACK AGAINST SUPREME COURT OFJUSTICE PRESIDENT MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO.   THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE READS: ON THE AFTERNOON OF 2 JULY, FMLNGUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY AND OCCUPIED 8 KM OF THEROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, BETWEEN THE 14- AND 21-KM MARKERS, WHERETHEY ERECTED A BARRICADE.  THE GUERRILLAS ADDED THAT THEY STOPPEDAPPROXIMATELY 200 VEHICLES TO MEET AND EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH THEDRIVERS.   AT THE 14-KM MARKER, A VEHICLE IN WHICH (ROBERTO MATIS REGALADO\\'S)BODYGUARDS WERE RIDING ARRIVED, BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT OBEY THE ORDERTO STOP, WHICH PROVOKED A CLASH WITH OUR UNITS.  TWO MEN WERE WOUNDEDAND ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF THAT INCIDENT.   OUR FORCES REPORTED THAT THEY SEIZED ONE M-16 RIFLE AND ONE .45 -CALIBER PISTOL.  THE FMLN DOCUMENT ADDS THAT MINUTES LATER, AT THE21-KM MARKER, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT\\'S BODYGUARDSTRIED TO SURPRISE OUR FIGHTERS AND ANOTHER CLASH OCCURRED. DURING THECLASH, ONE BODYGUARD WAS KILLED AND THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICANALLIANCE] OFFICIAL WAS WOUNDED.   PARAGRAPH THREE OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE ARMED PROPAGANDAACTIVITIES ALONG THE LA LIBERTAD PORT - SAN SALVADOR ROUTE ARE AIMEDAT DISTRIBUTING PROPAGANDA AND AT DESTABILIZING THIS VITAL ROUTE USEDBY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MILITARY MEN TO TRAVEL TO THEIR PRIVATECLUBS LOCATED ALONG THE COAST.   THE FMLN, THE DOCUMENT ADDS, REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO STOPTHOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE GENOCIDAL WAR -- THOSE WHO EVERY DAYSHELL THE RURAL AREAS AND PERSECUTE AND MURDER PEASANTS, WORKERS, ANDSTUDENTS -- FROM TAKING IT EASY AND RELAXING AT THEIR CLUBS AND INTHEIR EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL POLICESTATION AT THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD FOLLOWS THISSAME LINE OF DESTABILIZATION.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON OUR PEOPLE TO PAYATTENTION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ORDERS ISSUED BY OUR FIGHTERS ANDTO THEREBY PREVENT REGRETTABLE LOSSES.  WE WARN BODYGUARDS ANDSECURITY GUARDS THAT WE WILL FIGHT THOSE WHO ARE ARMED AND WHO OFFERRESISTANCE.   IN CONCLUSION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO ADDS:WE REITERATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY OUR REVOLUTIONARYPRINCIPLES AND STICK TO THE TRUTH.  WE DID NOT PARTICIPATE ININCIDENTS SUCH AS THE ATTACK AGAINST [PRESIDENCY MINISTER] ANTONIORODRIGUEZ PORTH AND EDGAR CHACON [IDEOLOGUE OF THE ORLANDO DE SOLAGROUP].  THESE INCIDENTS RESULTED FROM A WAR WITHIN ARENA RANKS, ANDWE WARN THAT ACTS OF REPRESSION UNLEASHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINSTTHE POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED AND WILLRECEIVE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM OUR FORCES.   THIS WAS THE RECENT FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE INCIDENTS THAT OCCURREDON 2 JULY ON THE ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THESUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE WAS WOUNDED.TST1-MUC3-0047   QUITO, 26 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] ECUADOR TODAY CONCEDED THEPOSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN ECUADORANTERRITORY, ALTHOUGH IT EMPHASIZED THAT BORDER CONTROLS HAVE BEENREINFORCED \"TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF VIOLENCE AND TERROR.\"   ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE PRESENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE MEDELLINCARTEL, INTERIOR MINISTER ANDRES VALLEJO SAID: \"IT IS POSSIBLE.HOWEVER, THERE ARE QUITE RELIABLE REPORTS THAT THEY (THE DRUGTRAFFICKERS) HAVE MORE LIKELY FLED TO OTHER COUNTRIES.\"   THE MINISTER REVEALED THAT A FINANCING COMPANY, WHICH HE DID NOTIDENTIFY, WAS CLOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND TO BELAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED FROM THE TRAFFICKING.  \"THERE WILL BE NOMERCY IN SUCH CASES,\" HE SAID.   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, PRESS REPORTS MENTIONED ECUADOR AS ONE OFTHE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE TOP LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HADREPORTEDLY TAKEN REFUGE TO ESCAPE THE ACTIONS LAUNCHED BY THECOLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING A SERIES OF ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTED BYTHE DRUG MAFIAS.  EARLY THIS WEEK, ECUADOR REINFORCED ITS EXTENSIVEBORDER WITH COLOMBIA TO KEEP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS OUT.   ASSESSING THE STATUS OF DRUGS IN ECUADOR, THE MINISTER ADMITTEDTHAT \"SEVERAL LARGE ESTATES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY PEOPLE WHO APPEARTO BE LINKED TO THE DRUG TRAFFIC.\"  HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED THE OPINIONTHAT THESE PURCHASES WERE LINKED TO MONEY LAUNDERING RATHER THAN THEPRODUCTION OF DRUGS.   VALLEJO ALSO SAID THAT ECUADOR HAS \"SEVERELY\" RESTRICTED IMPORTS OFCHEMICAL SUBSTANCES USED IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASES OF THE REFINING OFNARCOTICS.  FORMER FREE ACCESS TO THOSE SUBSTANCES HAD BEEN CONVERTINGTHE COUNTRY INTO AN ALTERNATIVE BASE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENTOF DRUGS TO THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE.TST1-MUC3-0048   BOGOTA, 6 JUN 89 (EMISORAS CARACOL NETWORK) -- [TEXT] PASTO --COMMERCE AT THE ECUADORAN BORDER IS VIRTUALLY PARALYZED AFTER THEBORDER WAS CLOSED IN THE WAKE OF SERIOUS INCIDENTS BETWEEN STRIKINGTRANSPORTERS AND ECUADORAN POLICE.

MEANWHILE, THESITUATION REMAINS TENSE IN THE REST OF ECUADOR BECAUSE OF THEPROLONGED STRIKE OF DRIVERS WHO ARE PROTESTING AGAINST DRASTICECONOMIC MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT RODRIGOBORJA.

WHY NOTALLOW CITIZENS TO FREELY AND SPONTANEOUSLY EXCERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTEAGAIN.  THIS WOULD CONTINUE THE DEMOCRATIZATION AND DECENTRALIZATIONPROCESS NEEDED BY THE COUNTRY TO PROGRESS AND FIND PEACE.  I BELIEVEWE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WONDERFUL SERVICES RENDERED BY DR.RAFAEL PARDO, THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION PLAN DIRECTOR, TO ATTEMPT TOFIND NEW ROADS TOWARD ACHIEVING DIALOGUE WITH THESE TWO SECTORS,ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELN.  IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND PEACE, ESPECIALLY FORTHIS DEPARTMENT.  WE MUST AT LEAST MAKE ATTEMPTS TO HOLD DIALOGUE WITHTHIS GUERRILLA GROUP, WHICH HAS SHOWN IT CAN EASILY MOVE AROUND ANDDISRUPT STABILITY AND PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NORTHSANTANDER.   [REPORTER] MR. GOVERNOR, UP TO NOW, HAVE ELN OR EPL SUBVERSIVESTRIED TO ATTAIN THIS DIALOGUE?   [ASSAF] WELL, NO.  IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY, BESIDES WE BELIEVE THESEARE INITIATIVES THAT SHOULD BE STARTED BY THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS, ASTHEY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN SUCH CONVERSATIONS, CONTACTS, AND DIALOGUES.THAT IS WHY I MENTIONED THAT, PERHAPS, THROUGH DR. RAFAEL PARDO, WHOHAS BEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT\\'S DELEGATE, ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TOSEARCH FOR SUCH POSSIBILITIES.  I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEENMAKING EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE QUICKER WEATTAIN THIS, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OFCOLOMBIA.   [REPORTER] HAVE YOU ALREADY SENT AN INVITATION OR ASKED DR.  RAFAELPARDO TO COME TO YOUR DEPARTMENT?   [ASSAF] WE HAVE TALKED TO HIM OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THEPUBLIC ORDER SITUATION AND OTHER SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIALATTENTION.  HOWEVER, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT DR. PARDO HAS BEENWORKING VIRTUALLY FULL-TIME TO FURTHER THE PEACE CONVERSATIONS WITHM-19.  THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PLEASED AND VERY HAPPY WITH THESECONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT INITIATION FORPRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO\\'S PEACE PROCESS.   [REPORTER] BUT DR. RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OFHOLDING SUCH CONVERSATIONS?   [ASSAF] I AM SURE HE DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA BECAUSE HE HAS BEENTRYING TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME.   [REPORTER] WHEN COULD THESE CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE?  JUST GIVE USA TENTATIVE DATE.  COULD IT BE WITHIN DAYS OR THIS WEEK?   [ASSAF] SURELY THIS WEEK WE WILL AGAIN HAVE TO STUDY THE PUBLICORDER SITUATION IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND SURELY WE WILL BE ABLE TOANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN AND I BELIEVE DR. PARDO WILL SERIOUSLYTAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT.   [REPORTER] SOME OF THE COUNTRY\\'S POLITICAL LEADERS -- NOT ONLY INNORTHERN SANTANDER, BUT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERYCONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSTANT RAIDS BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, AND THEIRMURDERED MAYORS, OFFICIALS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE KIDNAPPINGOF NATIONAL CIVIL REGISTRY OFFICE PERSONNEL.  THEY INDICATE THAT WITHACTIONS OF THIS TYPE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FREELYEXPRESS THEMSELVES BY VOTING IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.   [ASSAF] YES, SURELY ALL THESE INCIDENTS CAN, IN A CERTAIN MANNER,WEAKEN THE ELECTORAL VOTE.  HOWEVER, EVERYDAY WE ARE MORE CONVINCEDTHAT COLOMBIANS WANT TO EXCERCISE THIS RIGHT WITHOUT ANY TYPE OFLIMITATIONS AND MAKE EFFORTS -- INCLUDING HEROIC ACTIONS -- TOCONTINUE THIS CAMPAIGN SO THAT ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD THROUGHOUT THENATIONAL TERRITORY.  VOTING IS THE REAL EXPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY AND WEWILL ALL FIGHT FOR IT.  WE ARE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THEARMED FORCES, WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTIONSTO BE HELD WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  HOWEVER, IT IS A HUGE EFFORT, AS IT HASTO CONFRONT A SERIES OF APPREHENSIONS OR FEARS THAT HAVE BEENINSTILLED IN SOME PEOPLE.  [CONTINUED]TST1-MUC3-0053   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH COMMANDER JORGE MELENDEZ][TEXT] [CONTINUED] [MELENDEZ] COL VARGAS\\' REACTION WAS TO BECOMEDESPERATE BECAUSE 90-MM, 60-MM, AND 81-MM MORTARS, AND 85-MM FIELDGUNS HAVE BEEN INDISCRIMINATELY FIRED AGAINST THAT SECTOR OF THENEIGHBORHOOD FOR 3 DAYS; ROCKETS HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM AIRPLANES.  MANYCIVILIANS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND MANY HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  INOTHER WORDS, THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER -- PERHAPS BECAUSETHOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LOCATED CLOSEST TO THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE,AND THAT SEEMS TO WORRY THIS MAN VERY MUCH.  THIS COULD BE THE REASONFOR SUCH AN ATTITUDE AND FOR THAT GENOCIDAL SITUATION.   IN OTHER PLACES, CLASHES OCCURRED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY LONG ON 12AND 13 NOVEMBER, AND DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 14 NOVEMBER INTHE MILAGRO DE LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE CAUSED A CONSIDERABLENUMBER OF CASUALTIES.  IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES FOILED AND STOPPED THEARCE BATTALION, PONCE BATTALION, LEON BATTALION, AND THE MONTERROSAFORCES [78-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] SURVEILLANCE ANDSECURITY MEASURES, AND TO HANDLE ANY TYPE OF EMERGENCY, INCLUDINGBOMBINGS, MORTAR ATTACKS, AND STRAFINGS.  THIS MEANS THAT THE TERRAINMUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE POPULATION.   WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF INSTRUCTION REGARDING THE TASKS TO BE DONEDURING TIMES OF COMBAT, BUT THIS IS GEARED TOWARD THE POPULATION WHODECIDES TO PARTICIPATE BY DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN.  THIS INVOLVESMANY PEOPLE.  THEY CAN JOIN NEW FORCES AND GROUPS IN CHARGE OF THETRENCHES, SECURITY MEASURES, COURIERS, AND ALL KINDS OF TASKS TOSUPPORT THE WAR.   IN SUM, THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POPULATION ARE TO ORGANIZETHEMSELVES BECAUSE, ONCE ORGANIZED, THEY CAN GIVE [4-SECOND BREAK INRECEPTION] AND COUNTER IT.  THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE CALLS TOTHE POPULATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRUGGLE AND ABOVE ALL [7-SECONDBREAK IN RECEPTION] NOT TO LET ANYONE INTIMIDATE THEM.  THEYSHOULD NOT LET ANYONE STOP THEM FROM GOING OUT TO PURCHASE THEIR FOODAND WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED.   GIVEN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE ANDFOOD, WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL TO OPENTHE STORES WHERE THEY CAN GET FOOD, MEDICINE, AND ANY OTHER ITEMSWHICH ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR THEIR [WORD INDISTINCT] AND SURVIVAL.THAT IS ALL FOR NOW.  GREETINGS TO THE COMRADES WHO ARE LISTENING INTHE CAPITAL, ALL THE COMRADE FIGHTERS, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE INGENERAL.  THEIR HIGH MORALE AND ACTIVE ROLE IN THE CAPITAL MAKES USFEEL PROUD.  WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE VICTORY IS GUARANTEED.  WE AREPREPARED TO DO LIKEWISE AND WE SEND THEM THE COURAGEOUS, FRATERNAL,AND REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS FROM ALL THE COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS INSAN MIGUEL. TST1-MUC3-0054   LIMA, 15 AUG 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [PERUVIANPRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA] [TEXT] GOOD EVENING. THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN ISNOW UNDER WAY.  TEN CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF LIMA.  WE MUSTPARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.   HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE USFORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OURFATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTSECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEEDFOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES.   WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONALPOLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THEMOUNTAIN RANGE.  THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS.HOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGHTHE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES.   IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGALPUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED.STIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES.   THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE,DRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY IPROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRYTERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECTBECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. IWOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS ANDINSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED INCONGRESS.   BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UPANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.   FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU\\'SDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THEBATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARYCOURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULDIMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THEFACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKEDFOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES.SO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, ASPRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUTDELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS.   FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OFPERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENTOF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS ANDTHEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE.   THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAYTHAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALFTRUE.  ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY,POLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARYJURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOTAPPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235,WHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OFBETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR.   NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOTWANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHOAVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OFJUSTICE.  THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLYALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSETERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEYCOMMIT CRIMES.   MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARYSERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO,AFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2YEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THECOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.   THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THECOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANSWHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIRMILITARY OBLIGATIONS.

GOVERNMENTREPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE INSURGENTS WILL NOT ONLY STEP UP THEIRACTIONS TO DESTROY THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND MURDER GOVERNMENTOFFICIALS, BUT ALSO THREATEN TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AGAINSTTHE CITY.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] ALTHOUGH THE PEACE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY, WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONALLIBERATION FRONT] COMMAND HAS AUTHORIZED A PLAN TO STEP UP VIOLENCE INSAN SALVADOR THROUGH THE USE OF GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES.   WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NO WILLINGNESS TO BRING ABOUTPEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. THE MEDIA SHOULD REVEAL TO ALL SALVADORANS ANDTHE ENTIRE WORLD WHAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO DO.  [END RECORDING]   ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THESE FMLN PLANS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TOTHE PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO.  WHEN ASKEDWHETHER THESE ACTIONS PLANNED BY THE FMLN COULD HARM THE TALKS INCOSTA RICA, CRISTIANI SAID THAT THIS WILL DEPEND ON THE SITUATION THATPREVAILS AT THE MEETING.  HE ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENTOPPOSES THE USE OF THE TALKS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IF THE FMLN WANTS TO USE THE PROCESSFOR TACTICAL PURPOSES, WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO THEIR GAME.  OUROBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO SEEK PEACE IN GOOD WILL.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WEWILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO A FMLN TACTICAL GAME.  I DO NOT BELIEVETHAT WE CAN MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS AT THIS MOMENT.  THE OUTCOME WILLDEPEND ON THESE ALLEGED PLANS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN COSTA RICA.  [ENDRECORDING]   AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS ROUND OF TALKS.THUS, THIS MEETING COULD BE CRUCIAL FOR ACHIEVING NATIONAL PEACE.CRISTIANI MAINTAINED THAT THIS MEETING WILL BE USEFUL TO GAUGE THEINTENTIONS OF THE GUERRILLA FRONT.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE WILL PRESENT A GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL.IT IS AN BROAD PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH VARIOUS ISSUES, EVEN THEPOSSIBLE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN TO CIVILIAN AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE.IT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES, A TOPIC THAT WEHAD AGREED TO ADDRESS IN COSTA RICA DURING OUR MEETING IN MEXICO.  WEARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC THAT IS WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY.  [END RECORDING]   THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED AS BENEFICIAL THE UN AND OAS PRESENCE ATTHE TALKS, BECAUSE THEY WILL GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTSSIGNED IN COSTA RICA.   ONLY A DAY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTAND THE FMLN, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT DESPITE AN INCREASE IN WARACTIONS, THE MEETING IN COSTA RICA WILL NOT FACE OBSTACLES.TST1-MUC3-0059   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JUN 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [ERNESTORIVAS] [TEXT] PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HOLDS THE FARABUNDO MARTINATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OFDR JOSE ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH AND CALLED THE ATTACK AN ATTEMPT TOHINDER DIALOGUE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED 3 DAYS OF NATIONALMOURNING IN HONOR OF THE SLAIN MINISTER.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND LEGALLY.  WEWILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE REQUISITE EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO FINDAND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIME AGAINST THE LIFE OF ANEXEMPLARY CITIZEN. [END RECORDING]   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BLAMED THE FMLN FOR MINISTER RODRIGUEZPORTH\\'S DEATH.  HE SAID THIS ATTACK IS PART OF A SERIES OF ACTIONSAIMED AT DESTABILIZING THE NEW GOVERNMENT.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE ARE VIRTUALLY CONVINCED THAT THISWAS AN FMLN EFFORT, AN FMLN INCIDENT, TO TRY AND PROVOKE A REACTIONFROM OUR GOVERNMENT.  WE FEEL THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLYSHOW US WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT; HOWEVER, IREPEAT WE ARE ALMOST SURE THAT THIS WAS DONE BY THE FMLN.   WE HAD HOPED THE FMLN WOULD REFRAIN FROM THIS TYPE OF BARBARICACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS THE DUTY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITYCORPS TO OFFER PROTECTION.  THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED: TOOFFER GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THE PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]   DURING THIS EVENING\\'S RADIO VENCEREMOS NEWSCAST, HOWEVER, THEREBELS NEITHER CLAIMED NOR DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE BEENCARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN IN AN ATTEMPT TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAD LEARNED, EVEN BEFORE THEINAUGURATION, THAT THE FMLN WOULD TRY TO HINDER THE TRANSITION FROMONE GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER AND LATER CREATE ANARCHIC SITUATIONS FOR THENEW GOVERNMENT. THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT PLAN.   I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE THE FMLN\\'S WAY TO FORCE US TO SITDOWN AND TALK.  IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE THAT AFTER RECEIVING A FORMALOFFER TO SIT DOWN TO TALK -- FIRST ABOUT THE MECHANISMS TO BE USED ASGUIDELINES DURING THE TALKS AND LATER TO BROACH THE MAIN ISSUES IN ANATTEMPT TO REACH A LASTING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY -- THE FMLN SHOULDSTILL THINK THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY.

THE AGGGRESSIVE SEARCH FOR NEW MARKETS DOES NOTRESPECT OCEANS, JUST AS IT HAS NOT RESPECTED BORDERS.  ANYWHERE THEREARE CONSUMERS, THERE WILL BE SUPPLIERS.  IN FACT, COCAINE IS BUT ONEOF THE PERNICIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CRISIS OF DRUG ABUSE, WHICH ISMUCH BROADER.  WE MUST NOT DELUDE OURSELVES.  THIS SCOURGE AFFECTS USALL.   ACTING IN SOLIDARITY, AS A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, WE MUST FOLLOWTHIS PLAN OF ACTION:   FIRST, IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CURB THE DEMAND FORILLEGAL DRUGS.  DRUG ABUSE IS THE FUEL THAT PROPELS NARCOTERRORISM.TODAY IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO LATIN AMERICANDEMOCRACIES.  COCAINE USERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE KILLING OF MYPEOPLE BY THE CRIMINAL INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION.WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, IN ANY OF THE DISTINGUISHED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTSOF THIS CITY, A HABITUAL COCAINE USER MAY REGARD MY ASSERTION AS ANEXAGGERATION.

[APPLAUSE]   NO WEAPON OR TACTIC USED IN THIS STRUGGLE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGHIF IT IS NOT COMBINED WITH RESOLUTE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND.  THEILLEGAL PROFITS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE.  I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL DEFEATTHE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN COLOMBIA, BUT SOMEONE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY,SOMEWHERE, WILL TAKE OVER THIS BUSINESS AS LONG AS IT REMAINS SOPROFITABLE.  THIS HAPPENED WITH MARIJUANA.  WHEN IT BECAME TOO COSTLYFOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE OF THEEFFECTIVENESS OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, THE TRADERS IN VICE MOVED THEIRPLANTATIONS TO CALIFORNIA, TO HAWAII, AND TO MANY OTHER REGIONS.  THEONLY LAW THE DRUG RUNNERS DO NOT VIOLATE IS THE LAW OF SUPPLY ANDDEMAND.  [APPLAUSE]   NO SOCIETY, REGARDLESS OF HOW WEALTHY IT IS, CAN AFFORD THE LUXURYOF ALLOWING ITS SONS OR DAUGHTERS TO POISON THEMSELVES WITH COCAINE,HEROIN, MARIJUANA, OR ANY OTHER SUCH DEADLY DRUGS.  IN THIS CONTEXT, IWISH TO ASSERT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH\\'S PLAN TO CURB THE DEMAND IS AFIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  WE MUST INSIST ON THE MESSAGE THATILLEGAL DRUGS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE OR HARMLESS, WHETHER THEY ARECONSUMED IN THE GLITTERING PARTIES OF THE RICH OR IN THE SLUMS.[CONTINUED]TST1-MUC3-0078   BOGOTA, 15 NOV 89 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] MONTERIA --BLOODY CLASHES HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE RURAL AREA OF PUERTOLIBERTADOR MUNICIPALITY, SOUTH OF CORDOBA, SINCE 11 NOVEMBER.

ALL THE DEMOCRATS OF THE AMERICAS WHOSEE IN YOU, MR. PRESIDENT PEREZ, A GREAT FIGHTER, ARE NOW CELEBRATINGA POSITIVE WAVE OF LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE IN URUGUAY,CHILE, BRAZIL, COSTA RICA, AND NICARAGUA.  VERY SHORTLY COLOMBIA ANDLATER PERU WILL HOLD ELECTIONS.  PANAMA, IN TURN, HAS CALLED FORPOPULAR CONSULTATION IN THE FORM OF A REFERENDUM SO THAT THE PEOPLEWILL DECIDE ON IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.   THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, DEMOCRACY IS THE PATH AND THAT IS WHY ITWILL BE THE ADEQUATE MEANS FOR STRENGTHENING THE OAS AS A REGIONALORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TRENDS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN ACOMMON OBJECTIVE OF SEARCHING FOR PEACE, FREEDOM, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICEMAY AND SHOULD BE EXPRESSED AND CONSULTED ON.  THERE, THE MEMBERS WILLBE ABLE TO DISCUSS TOPICS THAT AFFECT US IN A DIRECT MANNER, SUCH ASINTERNATIONAL TRADE, FOREIGN DEBT, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION, AS WELLAS HOW TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ACTION WITH VARIOUS INTERLOCUTORS,SUCH AS THE CASE OF CANADA, THE ENTRY IF WHICH INTO THE OAS WE WARMLYWELCOME.   THEREFORE, LET US CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS MEETING WHICH WE DONOT HESITATE IN TERMING HISTORIC.  THE DOCUMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF HOWMUCH WE HAVE ADVANCED IN SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELDS OFENERGY, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND BORDER TRANSIT; IN JOINTPROGRAMS IN CITY PLANNING SUCH AS THE CUCUTA-VILLA EL ROSARIO-SANANTONIO-URENA; IN THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS, ANDIN INDIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, CUSTOMS, AND EDUCATION.  ALL OF THESE ARETOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVETEAMS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE.   THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST ANDDEMOCRATIC PROJECT.  THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVENATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARDWORKING PEOPLE.  THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HEEXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION,AND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES ANDCONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS.  OUR COMMISSIONS HAVESUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATERBASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADYBEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS.   COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, ANDUNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR.THE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY ANDTELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUSALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGESTHAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZAAIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THEAGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGINGFROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERSTO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS.   THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONALCONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL,IT POINTS TO PEOPLE\\'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FORCONSUMPTION.  IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THEPEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHINGOR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE\\'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED.   I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAYIS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICANINTEGRATION.  BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIRRULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAYCONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENTIN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR,BOLIVAR.   MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TOWORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO.

WHAT WE DID WASSUSPEND THE MEETING THAT HAS CREATED SO MANY EXPECTATIONS.  THE SANJOSE AGREEMENT STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A CEASE-FIRE AND A GRADUALPROCESS TO PUT AN END TO HOSTILITIES THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE END OF THEWAR; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE DONE, WE MUSTFIRST HAVE SPECIFIC DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS.  THAT IS WHAT CRISTIANISIGNED IN TELA, HONDURAS.  WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE IS THE UNMASKING OFA FASCIST DICTATORSHIP.

[CORRECTS HIMSELF] OUR CAPITAL, AND THIS WAS STATED BYTERRORISTS WHO HAVE SURRENDERED AND TERRORISTS WHO HAVE BEENAPPREHENDED. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THE CAPITAL UNDERFALSE PRETENSES. THEY WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE GOING ALONGFOR A RIDE AND THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD SUPPORT THEM, AND THAT THEARMED FORCES WOULD NOT PUT UP A FIGHT. THIS, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,HAS BEEN THE HARSHEST BLOW FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLEREJECTED AND SPURNED THEM WHEN THEY TRIED TO EXPOSE THE PEOPLE TO SOMUCH DANGER AND HARM.   IT WAS ALSO SATISFACTORY TO HEAR THE MANY STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT ANDSOLIDARITY GIVEN BY SO MANY SALVADORANS. THEY HAVE TALKED THROUGH THENATIONAL NETWORK AND EVERY OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, AND HAVEREJECTED AND SPURNED THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS.  FURTHERMORE,THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMYARE DRAFTING A PROGRAM TO HELP THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH HAVE BEENAFFECTED BY THE FMLN\\'S ACTIONS--ONCE EVERYTHING IS CALM--AND TORESUPPLY THE SUPERMARKETS AND STORES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE KNOWTHE PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS GETTING FOOD FOR THE LAST 2 AND 1/2 DAYSAND THE SUPPLIES SHOULD BE BROUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE DO NOT WANT TO END THIS ADDRESS WITHOUTSTATING OUR DEEP GRATITUDE FOR YOUR--AND THE OTHER SALVADORANPEOPLE\\'S--COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION. WECAN ONLY FEEL PROUD ABOUT THE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT--NOT FOR US ON APERSONAL BASIS BUT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, THE RIGHTS THAT THESALVADORAN PEOPLE DEMAND--AND FOR THE SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE ARMEDFORCES, WHOSE MORALE IS HIGH AND WHO TAKE PRIDE IN THE PROFESSIONALISMWHICH THEY HAVE ACQUIRED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO COUNTER THE SITUATIONIN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE.   WE KNOW THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED, AND NOW IT IS A MATTER OF TIMEBEFORE THE ARMED FORCES MANAGE TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUNDCOMPLETELY. ALSO, WE WANT TO STATE OUR DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE FRIENDLYCOUNTRIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY-- MOST OF ALLTHEIR SOLIDARITY WITH YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE-- BECAUSE THERE HAVEBEEN STATEMENTS WHICH, FRANKLY, HAVE FILLED US WITH EMOTION. FOREXAMPLE, THOSE OF COSTA RICA, THE UNITED STAES, GUATEMALA, AND, INSHORT, ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW IRRATIONALTHE FMLN\\'S AGGRESSION IS. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ANDTHE REPUBLIC, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\\'S WILL,HAVE BEGUN A RATIONAL, PEACEFUL, AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ACHIEVEPEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.   TO CONCLUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ANDUNDERSTANDING; BUT ALSO YOUR TRUST AND SERENITY. YOU CAN REST ASSUREDTHAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS FROMTHE AGGRESSION WHICH THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE LAUNCHED. IT IS ADESPERATE ACTION AND, IN COUNTERING THE SITUATION, WE WILL BE MUCHCLOSER TO THE PEACE WE WANT SO MUCH.

TST1-MUC3-0091   CLANDESTINE, 28 MAR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WHEN NAPOLEONDUARTE WAS PROCLAIMED PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR IN 1984, THE WHITEHOUSE, STATE DEPARTMENT, PENTAGON, AND ALL THE POWERFUL CIRCLES IN THEUNITED STATES WERE STRICKEN WITH EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM.  DUARTEPROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIALREFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE.   ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON\\'SGREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHERWORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY.  FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN.  INREALITY 8 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE EL SALVADOR BECAME THE PLACE WHERETHE REAGAN ERA\\'S MODELS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY, NEODICTATORSHIP, ANDLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE WERE IMPLEMENTED.   WASHINGTON\\'S EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED.  THE19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION\\'SSALVADORAN STRATEGY.  TWO BASIC FACTORS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE U.S.FAILURE: FIRST, THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT DEMAGOGIC AND POLITICALLYUNSOUND REFORMS.  DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES\\'EXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION.  SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR,AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES\\' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WASPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORETHAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED.   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA ISTHE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHICSECTORS.  WASHINGTON HAS RETURNED TO ITS STARTING POINT.  THE $3BILLION SPENT ON MILITARY ADVICE AND THE GENOCIDE OF TENS OF THOUSANDSOF SALVADORANS SERVED NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER.  IT IS ALL OVER.  ARENAREPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979.  INOTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL,ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER.  THIS IS THE END, THE SAD END OF THELOW-INTENSITY WAR EXERCISE.   U.S. GENERAL HARRY GORDON SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE SANTA FE GROUP,IN HIS BOOK ON THE MISTAKES THE UNITED STATES MADE IN VIETNAM, SAIDTHE UNITED STATES\\' CONCEPT OF VICTORY AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN VIETNAM CANNO LONGER BE TO ACHIEVE ITS ENEMY\\'S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, AS INWORLD WAR II, BUT TO ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH ITSTARTED THE WAR.  THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED INLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.  ARENA\\'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TOTHE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OFLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.   FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WASSQUANDERED.  FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, IT MEANSRAZED TOWNS, DEVASTATED ECONOMIES, AND THE DEATH OF 70,000 PEOPLE.THE NEW U.S.  ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR ELSALVADOR.  WHAT IT HAS IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE ALLY, ARENA, AND A SOCIALTIME BOMB ABOUT TO EXPLODE.   THE FMLN BELIEVES THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD STUDY THE NEWSITUATION IN EL SALVADOR AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN A REALISTIC ANDPRAGMATIC MANNER.  THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR CONTINUES AND WILL CONTINUEAS LONG AS THERE IS NO CHANGE, NO REAL CHANGE, TO BENEFIT THE MASSESTHAT ARE STRUGGLING FOR THAT CHANGE.  THIS IS OUR NEW REALITY, AND IFTHE NEW U.S.  ADMINISTRATION WANTS PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE REGION,IT MUST ESTABLISH A FOREIGN POLICY THAT REFLECTS THAT REALITY.TST1-MUC3-0092   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] 4.AT 0640 AN FMLN GUERRILLA UNIT LAUNCHED AN ATTACK ON CONCHAGUABATTALION AND 3D MILITARY DETACHMENT SOLDIERS WHO WERE TRAVELING ONTHE ROAD BETWEEN ANAMOROS AND LISLIQUE, 1 KM FROM LISLIQUE, LA UNIONDEPARTMENT.

POLICESOURCES, HOWEVER, HAVE SAID THE ATTACKS COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BYTHE MAOIST \"SHINING PATH\" GROUP OR THE GUEVARIST \"TUPAC AMARUREVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT\" (MRTA) GROUP.  THE SOURCES ALSO SAID THAT THESHINING PATH HAS ATTACKED SOVIET INTERESTS IN PERU IN THE PAST.   IN JULY 1989 THE SHINING PATH BOMBED A BUS CARRYING NEARLY 50SOVIET MARINES INTO THE PORT OF EL CALLAO. FIFTEEN SOVIET MARINES WEREWOUNDED.   SOME 3 YEARS AGO TWO MARINES DIED FOLLOWING A SHINING PATH BOMBINGOF A MARKET USED BY SOVIET MARINES.   IN ANOTHER INCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO, A SHINING PATH MILITANT WAS KILLEDBY SOVIET EMBASSY GUARDS INSIDE THE EMBASSY COMPOUND.  THE TERRORISTWAS CARRYING DYNAMITE.

THE SPREADING WAVE OF TERRORISM, AIMED AT STOPPING THE ELECTIONSFROM TAKING PLACE, FORCED PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA\\'S ADMINISTRATION TOTAKE DRASTIC SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 3,500 CANDIDATES[PASSAGE INDISTINCT] ARE DEPLOYED, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS UNDER STATE OFEMERGENCY AND WHERE THE ACTIVITIES OF SHINING PATH\\'S TERRORIST GANGSARE MORE WIDESPREAD, SUCH AS LIMA AND THE DEPARTMENTS OF AYACUCHO,HUANCAVELICA, APURIMAC, AND JUNIN.   THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPOINTED FOUR MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TOPROTECT EACH CANDIDATE AND HAS TAKEN OUT LIFE INSURANCE ON ALMOST250,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY LOTTERY TO WORK AT OVER52,000 POLLING STATIONS.  IN LIMA ALONE, HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OFPOLLING STATION TEAMS HAVE ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF THIS DUTY,PETITIONS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN REFUSED BY THE THEELECTORAL COURT.   IN LIMA, THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO NORMAL ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY COULD BETHE STRIKE OF PRIVATE BUS OWNERS WHO ARE AFRAID OF TERRORISTREPRISALS.  THE \"MINI-BUS-OWNERS\" (INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OF URBAN BUSES)HAVE ASKED THAT FOUR POLICEMEN BE ASSIGNED TO EACH BUS, A REQUEST THATDEPARTMENTAL PREFECT (GOVERNOR) JACOBO MISHKIN HAS DEEMED\"IMPOSSIBLE.\"   \"IF THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION, THE PEOPLE WILL WALK,\" PRESIDENTALAN GARCIA HAS SAID, REAFFIRMING HIS \"ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE\" THAT THEPERUVIAN PEOPLE WILL VOTE EN MASSE -- DESPITE THE TERRORIST THREATS --TO \"STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY,\" RECOVERED IN 1980 AFTER 12 YEARS OFMILITARY GOVERNMENTS.  PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, NATIONAL ELECTION BOARDPRESIDENT CARLOS CASTANEDA, AND THE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN URGING THENEARLY 10 MILLION VOTERS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY BYCASTING THEIR VOTES.   THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT A LARGE TURNOUT WILL AMOUNT TO \"THE MOSTEFFECTIVE REJECTION OF SUBVERSION\" AND THAT IT WILL \"STRENGTHENDEMOCRACY\" IN PERU, WHICH HAS ALMOST 22 MILLION INHABITANTS.   OUT OF THE NINE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, FOUR HAVE THE BESTCHANCES, ALTHOUGH ONLY THE CANDIDATE OF THE CENTER RIGHT, MARIO VARGASLLOSA, IS THE CLEAR-CUT FAVORITE.  HE WILL GET AN ESTIMATED 45 PERCENTOF THE VOTES, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SURVEYS.   ACCORDING TO PERUVIAN LAW, IF VARGAS LLOSA DOES NOT GET ABSOLUTEMAJORITY HE WILL HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A RUNOFF ELECTION WITH THESECOND-PLACE CANDIDATE.  SINCE IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT VARGAS LLOSA,THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO), WILL WINTHE FIRST ROUND, THE QUESTION NOW IS WHO WILL BE HIS RIVAL FOR THEPRESIDENCY IN THE SECOND ROUND.  ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS, THECANDIDATES WITH THE BEST CHANCE ARE LUIS ALVA CASTRO OF THE RULINGAMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA), WITH 19 PERCENT OF THEVOTES; ALFONSO BARRANTES LINGAN OF THE SOCIALIST LEFT (IS), WITH 12PERCENT; AND HENRY PEASE OF THE COMMUNIST LEFT WING COALITION UNITEDLEFT (IU), WITH 8 PERCENT.   DURING THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF THEIR CAMPAIGNS THE CANDIDATES WILLSTEP UP THEIR TRIPS TO VARIOUS POINTS OF THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GAINTHE VOTES OF A LARGE UNDECIDED SECTOR OF THE POPULATION.  ACCORDING TOTHE SURVEYS, THIS SECTOR REPRESENTS BETWEEN 18 AND 20 PERCENT OF THEVOTES.   MEANWHILE THE TERRORISTS CONTINUE ON THEIR PATH OF DEATH ANDDESTRUCTION. IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THE SHINING PATH MURDERED TWO STATEOFFICIALS OF THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] ON A ROAD LINKING CHAVIN ANDHUARI, TWO TOWNS IN ANCASH DEPARTMENT.  IN HUARAZ, THE CAPITAL OFANCASH DEPARTMENT, THE TERRORISTS SET FIRE TO THE OFFICES OF THE LOCALDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BUT INJURED NO ONE.

SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THATSPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THEKILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRYFOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.   THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDOCRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT\\'S DECISION FURTHERISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSUREBECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARYAID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OFDOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.   THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.

I THEREFORE WANTED TOCONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOWTHEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.   FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMICAGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TOTACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TOMEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS,THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPEPROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.   THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINYHAS PLACED IN THE NATION\\'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING,COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TOFIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.   ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TOBOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCHTHREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, ORCOMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO-- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLYJEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOMTHEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IFTHEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOWCITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.   HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIRSUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YETWHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVELCHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOINGTHAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEANNATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARETHE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.   GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OFADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OFTREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES,FATHERLAND, OR LAW.   CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THEINSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HASMADE IN ALL FIELDS.   THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPESHAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THESHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOWCOUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO ALIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THATSOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUEEFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEANFRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMERMARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.   WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVERINTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS.I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. [CONTINUED]TST2-MUC4-0006   SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENTALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TOTHANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERYIMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVEHEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS AWORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHOHAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUROWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IFLOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THEGREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,AND WELL-BEING.   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WECONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORDMEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  AFEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OILPRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,AND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVENOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THEISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NOMONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORETHAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THEPRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  INGENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WESUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF AGOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDSAVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TOIMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LETUS THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORANFAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TOBENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TOBUY A VEHICLE.   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THISEXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUSCAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVELITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFOREHAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES ITPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIESTO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THECURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWNNOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NOPRICE INCREASE.   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANEGAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACESARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVESOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE ORNOTHING AT ALL.   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OFSOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS ISTHE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVELOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENTCHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WEMUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOTFIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE ANEFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITHTHE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THECHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUSTO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TOSENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELINGHAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WESHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREETDISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NOLONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TOSUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TOSEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES ANDACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.   THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OURCOUNTRY\\'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THEPHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALLSALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THATTHOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.   THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OFTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OURSOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYSKNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CANCOME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH ANDMAY GOD BLESS YOU.

PALERMO OWNS FOURTWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSOEXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THEBRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFININGTHE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.

MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEMSMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERESTOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE ISMORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THISINVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITYOF DRUGS EVERY DAY.   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OFTHEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEYFOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTOSUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, ISCARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLEFOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIANTRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,ARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNSOF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKESTHE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, INBOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TOSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTEWHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLEROFOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THETRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIESOF COCAINE.   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THEDRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER ANDACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THELARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OFDRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDENBY LAW.   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZREGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,AND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVETRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,AND EVEN IN CHILDREN\\'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BYBUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OFTRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THECOMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCEDIN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.

[GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TOEVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHERETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO ISCONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THEPRESIDENCY?   [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.   [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPESOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERYHONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, ANDDOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONEOUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH ISONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THEPEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OFTRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF ITFAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOUTHE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT ANDADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TOEDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.   [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALLPERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTSHIM.   [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVEME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]   [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?   [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THELEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE ANOUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDSINDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLEAND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THESUMMIT?   [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTIONTHREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED,MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITEDSTATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOTONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILLTACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TOBOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THECONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.

THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THEALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WASDISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, INWHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEINGCHARGED.   COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANSARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH INTHE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKINGWITH US.   [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARERIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVEORGINIATED?   [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYSTHOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORANGOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POORCOUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.   [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONSLIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?   [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEYCONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITHME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THECASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY\\'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANYDIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]   THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OFEMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEPCONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OFPROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.

WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLEOR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATIONFRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTICORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAINDOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY.

A REPORT SAYS THAT A DMIFA ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS\\'MILITARY DETACHMENT UNIT WAS AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL, AND THAT THEENTIRE UNIT WAS WIPED OUT.  THE SOLDIERS HAD A COMMUNICATIONS RELAYSTATION IN THE BUILDING. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, THERE WERE 20CASUALTIES. AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS A LIEUTENANT WHO WAS THE UNITCHIEF, AND TWO SERGEANTS. THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS TOTALLYDESTROYED.   THE SITUATION IS NOT AS THE FASCIST CRISTIANI REPORTED IT TO BE.  HESAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOLDIER AT THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING MEDICALTREATMENT. THAT IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE BUILDING HOUSED A GARRISON NOT AHOSPITAL, BECAUSE A DMIFA UNIT AND A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY CENTER WERETHERE. IT WAS A GARRISON.   WE ARE GOING TO CORRECT OUR REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE ATTACK ONTHE DMIFA UNIT: 20 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 10 WERE WOUNDED.  IN ALL,THERE WERE 30 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING TWO SERGEANTS AND THE UNIT CHIEF.WE REPEAT: IN AN IMPRESSIVE ATTACK ON A MILITARY POSITION AT SANTATERESA HOSPITAL--THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER A HOSPITAL BUT AN ARMYCOMMUNICATIONS CENTER--OUR FIGTHTERS ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED THATPOSITION.

THE TARGETS OF THE ATTACKS WERE THE BANCO CAFETERO BRANCHES AND ITSOFFICES IN MEDELLIN\\'S MIDDLE, WESTERN, AND SOUTHEASTERN AREAS.   ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, OVER 55 KG OF DYNAMITE WERE USEDIN THE ATTACKS.  THE RADIO REPORT ADDED THAT THE POLICE DEFUSEDANOTHER 20 KG OF EXPLOSIVES THAT HAD SLOW BURNING FUSES.   THE MEDELLIN CARTEL OPERATES IN THIS CITY LOCATED IN COLOMBIA\\'SNORTHEASTERN AREA.

PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATEDYESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THISWEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE,WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION.  I WOULDLIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. [LAUGHTER]   [CRISTIANI] YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN?   [REPORTER] YESTERDAY.   [CRISTIANI] WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY.  IWAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL ASMILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS.  HEWAS PRESENT.  UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT.  I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSEI HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAYAND HE WAS PRESENT.  PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDERFOR THE END OF THE MONTH.  I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THECOMMANDERS MEETING.  IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FORTHE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY.   [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX.   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AIDAFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS?   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN INTERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE.  A SIGN OF THIS WASTHE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULDINDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVEGROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR AMILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS.THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENINGOF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEYWOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARYPATH.  THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THEMINDS OF SOME.  THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLYCONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.   [MODERATOR] RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO.   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS\\' MORALE ATTHIS MOMENT?   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OFTHE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY.THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PARTIN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOTREPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OFFORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY.  ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATEDTHAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROWTHE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OFEVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF ELSALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEADTURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORTVIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITSMEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY ACOMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIREDOF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THEMILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANTTO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOTTHE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN ACOUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYINGTO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILLDESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCHTHAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.

THEREPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARESTILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATIONFRONT [FMLN].  ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOMEAREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THE REPORT ADDSTHAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.   SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION INVARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES AREMAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARYENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITHTHE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.   PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THECAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HEREIS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESSSHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIRPOSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.   WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THATSOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE AREMANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT ISTHE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS INZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITALCITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYINGTHEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.   WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATEWITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLYFOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS INSAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLNFIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THEREGIME\\'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT ISINCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE ASTATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SANSALVADOR.   ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT\\'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ONTHE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITSNEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN\\'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TONEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THISIS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THEANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THEPEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUTBY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.   COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG.YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRYOUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HASSAID.   COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE ASYOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIRCOOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SANSALVADOR.

PRESIDENT CRISTIANICONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONELROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACKTHIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA\\'S MURDER TO THEFMLN:   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOTWANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLNCOMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THISONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WEHAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN\\'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FORTHIS ACTION.   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THECOMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITHACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FORPEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR\\'S LEGAL FRAMEWORKAND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIRTERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESSFOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WEWILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILLACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THECOMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSIONIS FULLY FORMED.   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\\'S ROLE IN THISCOMMISSION?   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BEREPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSIONAND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THECHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTSTO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDTHIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TOPLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THEPOLITICAL COMMISSION.   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVEENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OURINABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATEOF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WEHAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OFGOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDERWAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENTOFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION\\'S PUBLICFINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY INVERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THELAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM.

THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANIGOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NOALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMEDACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION,ARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FINDSOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THEREGIME.

THE ARMED FORCES AND THEGOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESEATTACKS.   [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICALMOTIVATIONS.  OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY.  ALL OUR GUERRILLAUNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREASOR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE.   THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHEROPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THEFMLN\\'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN ORPOLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLEHERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVEPOLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.  IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVECAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTSIT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.

THE CALLER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS JOHN JAIRO ARIAS TASCON.  HECALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK IN MEDELLIN TO DENOUNCE THAT THE CHARGESAGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL ARE PART OF A PLAN TO BLAME THEM FOR ALLVIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.   THE AUTHORS OF THE ASSASSINATION ARE SECTORS WHO SEEK TODESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ARIAS TASCON ADDED.   PIZARRO, FORMER LEADER OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), THEGUERRILLA GROUP THAT LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH, WAS KILLED BYTHE IMPACT OF THREE BULLETS FIRED AT HIM ABOARD A COLOMBIAN AVIANCAFLIGHT THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO THE CITY OF BARRANQUILLA ALONG THECOUNTRY\\'S ATLANTIC COAST.   AFTER THE CRIME, AT 1100 (1600 GMT), AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IDENTIFIEDHIMSELF AS SAPATOCA CALLED CARACOL TO REPORT THAT THE KILLING HAD BEENORDERED BY FIDEL CASTANO AND HENRY PEREZ, HEADS OF THE EXTREMERIGHTIST PARAMILITARY MILITIAS.   SAPATOCA ADDED THAT CASTANO AND PEREZ PERPETRATED THE CRIMEFOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE EXTRADITABLES.   CASTANO WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ALSO APRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FOR THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), ON 22MARCH, ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTANO HEADED APARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT DID NOT IMPLICATE THE EXTRADITABLES.   ON THAT OCCASION PABLO ESCOBAR, LEADER OF THE EXTRADITABLES AND THEMEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD KILLEDJARAMILLO.   A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT DRAFTED RECENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVEDEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE), SAID THAT SOMEARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS COOPERATE WITH CASTANO\\'S CRIMINALORGANIZATION.   NAVARRO WOLFF, NUMBER TWO LEADER OF M-19, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY AFTERPIZARRO WAS KILLED THAT HIS BURIAL MUST BE ATTENDED BY ALL THECOUNTRY, BECAUSE WE MUST REPUDIATE CRIME SUCH AS THIS.

THE BURIAL OF CARLOS MUST BE PEACEFUL, AS WAS M-19\\'S EXAMPLE OFPEACE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED.   IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS SUCH AS THIS OCCUR WHEN THE M-19AND CARLOS PIZARRO WERE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF PRUDENCE, TOLERANCE, ANDUNDERSTANDING, NAVARRO SAID.   PIZARRO, A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER WHO LED HIS ARMED GROUPTOWARD DEMOBILIZATION AFTER 17 MONTHS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITHTHE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, TOLD NEWSMEN BEFORE BOARDING THEAIRCRAFT: WE ARE DOING WELL. THIS WAS A REFERENCE TO THE M-19ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.   PIZARRO STATED IN HIS LAST PUBLIC STATEMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT WEWILL KNOW HOW TO WAGE OPPOSITION.  WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTYDEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.  WE WILLPARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY.

[PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVENUS GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7\\'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCAAREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS ORMISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURESTHAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCETHE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMALLANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT ISPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANECRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICANPRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THEFMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPSTOWARD A DIALOGUE?   [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THEBEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TOTALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE APOSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.   HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US INAN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES ISREPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEATTHE FMLN.   BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVEINFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTEDAND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED ALARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7\\'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS,45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.   I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITHSUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.   I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEENABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVEALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THECIVILIAN POPULATION.   WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OFYOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELLAS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THENUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANSTHAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.   [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ALEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES ANDALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORANPATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  ITALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL ASTHEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET?IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?

HIS TRIUMPH IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR OUR IDEAS. MY CAMPAIGN WASCONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM -- BOTH POLITICAL ANDECONOMIC -- PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY.  IT HADTO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FUTURE CHILEANS WANT, AND IF OURIDEAS GAIN GROUND, THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAME OF THE MANCHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THEM.

I AM CONVINCED THAT AN INTELLIGENTOPPOSITION CAN DO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IF THATOPPOSITION IS BACKED BY THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAYSUPPORTED MY CANDIDACY.   THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WILL TO A LARGE EXTENT BE CARRIED OUT INCONGRESS.

THERE WAS A TRIUMPHANT PRESENTATION OFAN OFFER TO REDUCE A COUNTRY\\'S DEBT BY UP TO 20 PERCENT, BUT AS FAR ASWE KNOW THAT OFFER HAS NOT MATERIALIZED.  FURTHERMORE, A 20-PERCENTREDUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMSOF POVERTY AND THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA.  THEREDUCTION MUST BE MUCH GREATER.  A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILLDO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME.  WE BELIEVE -- AND I HAVEBEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERY LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT -- THAT ONLYTHROUGH OUR ADOPTION OF FIRM AND DIGNIFIED POSITIONS WILL THEADVERSARY RELENT.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]   [GARCIA] LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THEESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITIONHAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NORELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OFUNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS.COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTHKOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITIONTELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM.NOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARIABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODYHAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSECOUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZENORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION.   SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HASSAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE.THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTHKOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVEMADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OFCIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TOELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.   THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFFTO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.  IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITHAUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND.  ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THEPEOPLES OF THE WORLD.  UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THEFRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR.  THIS MANICHEANCRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGERVALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED.  HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THISCOUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN\\'T?  PERU WILL NOTACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS.  WE HAVE HADENOUGH OF THE 1960\\'S AND 1970\\'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOTTRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA.  PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TOTRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH.  THISIS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OFOFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE.   FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENTOF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OFTHE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.  THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLESPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HADBEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE.  JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOWMANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTSIN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS.  NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY AREOPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.

THE PROPOSAL COVERS THE SUPPLY OF OIL AND THE SALE OFFINISHED PRODUCTS.  ANOTHER POINT INCLUDED IS THE REFINANCING OF THEGUATEMALAN DEBT WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH TOTALS $200 MILLION.   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT\\'S ACTIVITIES BEGAN TODAY AT MIRAFLORESPALACE WHEN, PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE TWO AGREEMENTS, THEVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH HIS GUATEMALANCOUNTERPART.  THE PRESIDENTS THEN HELD A FORMAL WORK SESSION WITH THEPARTICIPATION OF TWO COMMISSIONS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL.  GUATEMALA,LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, AREFACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTSAS THEY MATURE.  THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONEOF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCETODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TORESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENTINTEREST.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THEVENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSEAGREEMENT.  FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FITVENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW ANDTHE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THETERMS.  WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THEMEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE ANDUNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. [END RECORDING]   WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEENVENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY.  ONE OF THEM IS ACOOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT.  ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC ANDTECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS,WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS.  AS ENERGY AND MINESMINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILLPERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARMAS] FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OILEXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THATCOULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA.

HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR \"FREEDOM,\" \"DEMOCRACY,\"AND \"HUMAN RIGHTS\" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OFTHE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT.   ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S.  TROOPS,EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTOPANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIONORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NOMEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA ANDKIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME.  THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENTESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF ATLEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OFTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.  MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY ANDADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BYU.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION.  THEUNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEWPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHERSTATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED [ASPUBLISHED] THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATICAPARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.UNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPSHAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TOPULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS.   JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENTIMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OFWARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHATWAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FORTRAFFICKING IN DRUGS.  ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES,IGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED AFLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"KENNEDY\" ANDNUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER \"VIRGINIA,\" TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO\"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING.\"  SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THESOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THEDEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKEDFIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS.JARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTICUNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES \"VERY NEARLY\" INVADED COLOMBIA.THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THEAUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPSARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR [AS PUBLISHED] THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA.  ITALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLSTO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY\\'S SOVEREIGNTY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEGOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TOJOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. \"DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL\" IN THE CARIBBEAN.  FACEDWITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE\"DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET\" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE \"DRILL.\"   ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOMELATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THESOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE \"RIGHT\" TO INTERFEREBY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES.  THEPUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S.AGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OFINTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OFWHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980\\'S.   IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE1980\\'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE,NAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTEDIN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES.  THEREAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS INCENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY.   IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION INCENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WONVICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING,AND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRALAMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTERADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH ACERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS.  IN 1977 THECARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THEPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVERTHE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE.  BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUAREVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORTFOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITHTHE SANDINISTA REGIME.

THE SITUATION IS UNDER THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES\\'CONTROL.   THE FLMN, WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, HAS UNLEASHED ANINDISCRIMINATE ATTACK ON VARIOUS PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR AND ON THECAPITALS OF FOUR DEPARTMENTS BY FIRING VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS AND KILLINGMANY CIVILIANS.     THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY REPORTS THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE THEFMLN ATTACKS ON MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED THELIVES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.   THIS FMLN ATTACK IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE DIALOGUEPROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTENDED THEMWITH TOTAL POLITICAL HONESTY, TRYING TO FIND MECHANISMS AND RATIONALSOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN NOT ONLY HAS VIOLATED THEAGREEMENTS IT SIGNED IN MEXICO CITY, BUT ALSO IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA.IT HAS ALSO BRAZENLY MOCKED THE FEELINGS AND THE DESIRE FOR PEACEWANTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.   THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTIONS HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE USEOF ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND SOCIETY BY USING THE ARMED FORCESWHICH HAS BEEN FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN PEOPLE DONOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR LIBERTY AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TOTALITARIANMARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONE THE FMLN WANTS TO IMPOSERUTHLESSLY.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHO HAVE OBSERVEDTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INCIDENTS CAN FULLY CONFIRM THE FACTS.

THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEENA SENSATION TO CHILE.  WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTICRADICAL CHANGES?   AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREATIMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND.  THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE.  THEOPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA INRELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANSTO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN.  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SITUATION LEAD TO AREDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING AND TO CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN THEPEOPLES.   DIE WELT: WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU SEE FOR A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY SUCH ASCHILE?   AYLWIN: I SEE TWO EFFECTS.  FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT.  CHILE ISTRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.  NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF ADICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER.  THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOMCOINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE.  THAT IS ASTIMULATING FEELING.  WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY.SECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OURCOUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATICFUTURE.  I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNIONDEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD.  NORFOR CHILE.   DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATINAMERICA.  HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED?  WHAT WAS ITS REACTION?   AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHICAND COHERENT PARTY.  IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONGTIME.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORETHE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATEDBY COMMUNIST PARTIES.  THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVEADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.   DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM,THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY?  DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM?DO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES?   AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTHSENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973.  WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WEOFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT APOLITICAL FUNCTION.  MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTENMISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM\\'SSECRET ALLY.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONSCAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT.  THAT HAS BEEN DONEIN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS.   DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY.  WILL IT BEREPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT?   AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL.   DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTERGOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITIONTODAY.   AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT.  THE VARIOUSSOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED.  HOWEVER, THE STRONGESTMOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER.   DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMAOF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE?   AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.  THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIESIN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIALDEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALISTFAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER.  THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE.   DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THESTRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAYIN THE FUTURE?   AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR.  ASIS THE CASE IN EVERY PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE CANNOT BE A MEMBER OFTHE GOVERNMENT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS.

[GIRON] WILL YOU ASK THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS BE RECONSIDERED?   [AZCONA] NO, I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE LAWON COFFEE TAXES WHICH COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PRODUCERS BECAUSE THELAW-DECREE ON COFFEE IS VERY DRASTIC.  HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY IS MAKINGPROGRESS, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS SECTORS--COMMERCE,CONSTRUCTION, AND MANUFACTURING--ARE ON THE INCREASE.  SOME SECTORSHAVE SOME PROBLEMS, BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE THOSEPROBLEMS.   [GIRON] DO YOU HAVE ECONOMIC ADVISERS, MR PRESIDENT?   [AZCONA] ANY PERSON CONSULTED IS AN ECONOMIC ADVISER.

HOW COULD I BE ALONE? ON THE CONTRARY, WE AREDOING WELL.  I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE MORE SUPPORT.  I DO NOTSEE WHY I COULD BE LEFT ALONE.  THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT AND THEEXPERTS.  WE ARE ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE PARTY, WITH THE MOSTIMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE PARTY.   [GIRON] ARE EMPLOYEES GOING TO BE PRESSURED?   [AZCONA] I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO DOANYTHING BECAUSE NO LAW SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYEES OF A GOVERNMENT MUSTSUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR PARTY.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT IF THE EXECUTIVEBRANCH WORKS IN UNISON, AS IT HAS BEEN DOING, THEN ALL MEMBERS OF THELIBERAL PARTY WILL BE HAPPY TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTY TOGUARANTEE A NEW VICTORY.

[GIRON] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EITHER YOUR GOVERNMENT OR YOURSELFCOULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY HARMED BY THE LATEST CRISIS ENDURED BY THECOUNTRY?   [AZCONA] I DO NOT THINK SO.

THE LOSS OF LIVES ISUNFORTUNATE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST A BUILDING AND FACILITIES NEXT TO THEU.S. EMBASSY IS REGRETTABLE BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT HELP THE COUNTRY.   [GIRON] HAVE YOU TALKED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT ANINDEMNITY?  IT IS BEING SAID THAT DAMAGE AMOUNTS TO $6 MILLION.   [AZCONA] NO, WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT $6 MILLION.

REGARDING THE STATE OFEMERGENCY, HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED POSITIVELY BECAUSE ONEMORE CASUALTY WOULD HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS.  THE STATE OF EMERGENCYMADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO COOL DOWN, AND THOSE ON THE STREETSRETURNED TO THEIR HOMES.  I FEEL IT WAS BENEFICIAL.  THE DECLARATION OFEMERGENCY DECREE WAS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION AND ON PRESIDENTIALAUTHORITY.  CONGRESS WAS INFORMED ABOUT THIS.

PERHAPS SOME PEOPLETRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL GAINS AND THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND.   I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EVERYTHING IS MORE OR LESS QUIET.  THEGOVERNMENT IS TALKING WITH THE VARIOUS SECTORS.  THERE IS A SMALLSTRIKE BY A SMALL GROUP OF HEALTH WORKERS.  CHECKS WITH SALARYINCREASES COVERING A 4-MONTH PERIOD WILL BE PAID TODAY.  SOMEREADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE TO FAVOR SOME EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOTRECEIVED THE INCREASES WE HAD PROMISED.

THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNIONFEDERATION [FENASTRAS] WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD.  THE SITE AND THEMOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED.   2.  WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THATTHIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT ANDAPPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THEHEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY\\'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE INRESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF.  THIS BEHAVIOR BYCRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE.  TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THENATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA].   ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THEMORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS.   3.  THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCEBECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL.   4.  THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITEPOSITION.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED ANIRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMESTHEY COMMIT.   IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE\\'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TOPREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THEGOVERNMENT\\'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OFMODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICALSUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR.   IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THATIT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, ANDTHEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.   WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSEORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARENOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE.   EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASEDITS REPRESSION.  SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS ANDATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE\\'SMOVEMENT AND THE UDN [NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION], UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN[MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS ANDRELATIVES], AND FENASTRAS.  MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HISHYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION.   THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THEREPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS\\'ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OFTHE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND,THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE.   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIRLEGITIMATE DEFENSE.  THE ARMED PEOPLE\\'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADEDBY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT]TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELYCONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TODEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND AREVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, ANDITS PROSPECTS.  MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OURPARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING.

CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THIS IS HIS FIRST REPORT TO THE NATIONAFTER 50 DAYS AS PRESIDENT.  HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE,THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OFVIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF \"INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS.\"  HE SAYS THAT THERE ISNO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFULSOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACEDIALOGUE, ADDING:  \"IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BEHELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SITDOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLEFOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS,THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKEPLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUEWILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENTHAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WEKNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DOSO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT,ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVETHAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FORYEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL ANOVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT\\'SPOSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOSTLOGICAL ONE.\"   TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TOSOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HESAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TOREFORM THE GOVERNMENT\\'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOMEGROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN APROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CANELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THEMAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THECONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLESLIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL ANDLARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.   REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREEDWITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE.TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THEPOPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TOOFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLETO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUETO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, ANDFASTER SERVICE.\"   ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TOELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED,THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TOLIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLYPROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THATWITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRICEXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"   TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKESHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKEMEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKEDTHE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TOCONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASICBREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO STARTELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARYINCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THEREST OF THE COUNTRY\\'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"   CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOMETAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ONREVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM\\'S PRESENTSITUATION.

DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WEREDIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAMEMORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONALFORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, ASMORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR AFREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OURORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THEWORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIREXPERIENCES.   2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONALSITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES\\'REVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THEGREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON APROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT,AND SOCIAL CHANGE.   3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONALSOCIALIST [SI] AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHINTHIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS.FIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLESTHE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEWDAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THECHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE\\'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERALASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSEWHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THESI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEANCAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FORDEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST ANDCOOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEASAND PROPOSALS PRAISED.   4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION ANDTRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALLPROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THETECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS,EXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THEEMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THEWORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OFLIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THEVALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES INTHE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THISFRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITSIDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS ABROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF ANAUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATEACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLEPLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE.[CONTINUED]TST3-MUC4-0027   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 AUG 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] DANILO BARILLAS, FORMERGUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIANDEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WAS KILLED TODAY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS INTHIS CAPITAL, THE POLICE REPORTED.

THISIS THE DOCUMENT I READ TWICE, AND I BELIEVE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS AND ASTEP FORWARD.   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE MERCENARIES TO LEAVE YOURCOUNTRY?   [AZCONA] FIRST, I DO NOT USE DEROGATORY TERMS.  THEY ARENICARAGUANS WHO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DISAGREE WITH THE SYSTEM INNICARAGUA.  THESE NICARAGUANS OPPOSE THE SYSTEM, AND FOR THIS AND OTHERREASONS THEY HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND HAVE TAKEN REFUGE INHONDURAS.  I DO NOT USE THE TERM MERCENARY.  I UNDERSTAND THE NICARAGUANGOVERNMENT USES IT AND IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO, BUT I WILL NOTANSWER A QUESTION THAT USES A TERM THAT I BELIEVE IS TOO DEROGATORY.   [REPORTER] THE DEMOBILIZATION PLAN HAS A VERY FIRM DEADLINE AND IS TO BECOMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS.  DO YOU THINK...   [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] NO, NO.  THE 90-DAY DEADLINE IS INCLUDED IN ANAGREEMENT SIGNED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA WITH THREE SMALL NICARAGUANLEFTIST PARTIES.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DOCUMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I DOBELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ANDTHE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS IIAND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS.

ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLESOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THEASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA [WORDSINDISTINCT], WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST].  THE COLOMBIAN DRUGMAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITHPOWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITEDSTATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD.   YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST], VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZSPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, ANDIT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IT ISIMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRESPEREZ.  WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US,ALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA.  WE MUST ALSOACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OURTIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARDDRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOSANDRES PEREZ.   IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERALLATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THESITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATINAMERICAN COUNTRIES.  NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM...[REPHRASES] AS HASBEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENTFIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BEBASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  THAT IS THE MAINSTUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THE UNITED STATES ISTHE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUGTRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELYREPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  U.S.  POLICY, AND ALL THIS IS VERY WELLKNOWN IN LATIN AMERICA, IS BASED ON DESTROYING THE PLANTATIONS OF A NATIVEPLANT IN THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS COCA.  PRESIDENTS, POLITICAL AND SOCIALFIGURES OF THE CONTINENT HAVE SAID THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT BASED ON THEDESTRUCTION OF A NATIVE PLANT BUT IN ACTIVE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG CONSUMPTION.   I THINK THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA AND THEDRAMATIC SITUATION THAT COLOMBIA IS FACING THESE DAYS CONFIRM THAT THEPOLICY FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST BE TENACIOUS, STRONG, WITHOUTHESITATION AND COMPASSION.  IT MUST ALSO BE BASED ON ENDING DRUG CONSUMPTIONBY THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN DRUG CONSUMER OF THE WORLD -- WHICH LIVESPRECISELY FROM DRUG CONSUMPTION AND ITS BUSINESS.

THESE TWOCOUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR COCAINE CROPS AND THE DRUG CARTEL\\'SORGANIZED ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION, EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WINGORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALSTHROUGH TERRORIST ACTIVITY.   HADASHOT HAS LEARNED FROM A SOURCE WHO WAS IN PERU FOR ABOUT 6MONTHS THAT ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE DRUG GROWERS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $9MILLION ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ARMS DEALERS IN 1987.  THEEQUIPMENT INCLUDED GALIL RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS, AMMUNITION BELTS ANDAMMUNITION, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES, AND COMMUNICATIONS AND NIGHTVISION EQUIPMENT.  IN 1988 AND 1989, IN ADDITIONAL DEALS WORTH SOME $6MILLION, MORTARS, SHELLS, SNIPER RIFLES, AND AMMUNITION FOR LIGHTWEAPONS WERE PURCHASED.   THE ARMS WERE SENT TO PERU VIA MEXICO AND GUATEMALA.  AT LEAST 3IDF [ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES] RESERVE OFFICERS WERE IN PERU FOROVER 2 MONTHS IN EARLY 1988 TO ORGANIZE FIGHTING UNITS.  THE PERUVIANFIGHTERS WERE PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS AS BELONGING TO RIGHT-WINGPOLITICAL BODIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS INCLUDEDMERCENARIES FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND ENGLAND.   THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS WAS MADE UP OF SOME 10 PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOMWERE RECRUITED THROUGH AN ISRAELI-NETHERLANDER ARMS DEALER WHO LIVESIN AMSTERDAM.  THE NETHERLANDS MEDIA IS CONDUCTING A WIDE-RANGINGINVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT DESPITE THE SURPRISING LACK OF INTERESTBY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES IN THE AFFAIR.   AT THE SAME TIME, ISRAELIS IN NEIGHBORING BOLIVIA ACTED ASINSTRUCTORS IN A COURSE ON SAFEGUARDING BUSINESSMEN, GUERRILLAWARFARE, AND REGIONAL DEFENSE.  THESE ISRAELIS REACHED BOLIVIA IN THEWAKE OF AN ARMS CONSIGNMENT WORTH SOME $12 MILLION, WHICH ARRIVED INPERU [COUNTRY AS PUBLISHED] VIA A THIRD PARTY, WHICH PURCHASED IT INAN AFRICAN COUNTRY, WHICH IN TURN HAD RECEIVED IT FROM ISRAEL.   FOLLOWING THE REPORTS ON DEALS BY ISRAELIS ABROAD, THE INCOME TAXINVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO TAX PAYMENTS ONISRAELI ARMS DEALS AND TRAINING ABROAD.   IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, THE SCOPE OF COMMISSIONS PAID TO ARMS DEALERSIS ESTIMATED AT $1 BILLION.

ON THAT DATE, MARTA LUCIA GONZALEZ, SECOND JUDGEOF PUBLIC ORDER, WROTE A FILE NOTE SAYING THAT THE JUDICIAL INSPECTIONWAS UNJUSTLY TORPEDOED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUNDAND THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS SENSELESS AND ILLOGICAL SINCE ABSOLUTELY NOONE OTHER THAN THE UNDERSIGNED JUDGE COULD DECIDE IF HE OR SHE HADANYTHING TO INSPECT, OR IF HE OR SHE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONDUCT THEJUDICIAL PROCEEDING.   THE DOCUMENT, WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE DOSSIER ON THE MASSACRE INLA HONDURA AND LA NEGRA, URABA REGION, SAYS THAT SHE WAS LEFT 2 DAYSINSIDE A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE TEXAS PETROLEUM COMPANY IN PUERTOBOYACA AND THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ACCOMPANYING HER FAILED TOEXPLAIN TO HER WHY THEY HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION.   [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] IN FACT, SHE AND SEVERAL DAS INSPECTORSENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLES.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE WASINFORMED OF THESE OBSTACLES IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION.I THINK THAT WHEN SHE AND THE DAS PERSONNEL WERE PREPARING TO GO TOPUERTO BOYACA IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE PRESENTTHERE FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THIS WAS QUITE WORRISOME.   [CORRALES] AS IS KNOWN, JUDGE GONZALEZ HAD TO LEAVE COLOMBIABECAUSE HER LIFE WAS THREATENED, AND HER FATHER, FORMER BOYACAGOVERNOR ALVARO GONZALEZ SANTANA, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED.   MOREOVER, GEN MAZA MARQUEZ SAID FURTHER THAT THE FACT THAT APAYMENT IS BEING OFFERED FOR THE CAPTURE OF PABLO ESCOBAR AND GONZALORODRIGUEZ GACHA DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER PERSONS ACCUSED OF BEINGCAPOS OF THE MAFIA ARE NOT BEING SOUGHT TOO.

COL PONCE SAID THAT WITH THIS ATTITUDE THE REBELS ARE NOT SHOWING AREAL DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND HE DESCRIBED IT AS A PROPAGANDISTIC ACTION.   TODAY, DURING HIS TOUR OF VARIOUS AREAS OF CONFLICT, COL PONCE SAIDTHAT RECENT FMLN ATTACKS ON VARIOUS MILITARY POSITIONS AS PART OF ITSLATEST CAMPAIGN FOLLOWING THE UNILATERAL TRUCE WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKEON THE PART OF THE REBEL COMMANDERS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT INTHE MIDST OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHICHHAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS CONTINUOUS.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THAT SHOWS THERE ARE, ON THE ONE HAND,THE PROPOSALS AND WHAT THE TERRORIST LEADERS CALL THEIR DESIRE FORPEACE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REAL ACTIONS.  I THINK THAT THECAMPAIGN THE FMLN HAS MOUNTED NATIONWIDE WAS A BAD STEP, BECAUSE ITDOES NOT SHOW A REAL AND SINCERE DESIRE TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.[END RECORDING]   COLONEL PONCE ADDED THAT THE REQUEST FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OFTROOPS AS STATED IN THE GUERRILLA PROPOSAL IS A POLITICAL MOVE.

IT IS A POLITICAL DECISION, AND THE ARMED FORCESWILL ACCEPT THE DECISION MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT.

TST3-MUC4-0043   NO CITY (EL SALVADOR), 29 SEP 89 -- [COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO MARTILIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] SUCH ANUNCONDITIONAL CEASE-FIRE DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE SPIRIT OF THEESQUIPULAS AND TELA AGREEMENTS AND THE ACCORDS THE GOVERNMENT AND THEFMLN SIGNED IN MEXICO IN WHICH THE SIDES CLEARLY AGREED TO FINDSOLUTIONS IN THE AREA AND IN EL SALVADOR.  ASKING FOR AN END TO THEWAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGEDWITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR.  IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS ISA FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR.   IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TOAGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE.  THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORANGOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THEESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS.  THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATIONOF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, ANDSELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE.  THIS CONCEPTIS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27JULY 1989.  IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE MEXICAN ACCORDREADS AS FOLLOWS: THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL TALK INAN EFFORT TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDETHE ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL FOSTER THE COUNTRY\\'SDEMOCRATIZATION AND REUNITE SALVADORAN SOCIETY.  THE DIALOGUE IS MEANTTO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON CESSATION OFHOSTILITIES.  THE AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED IN MEXICO SAYSNOTHING OF TALKING ABOUT OR NEGOTIATING THE FMLN\\'S DEMOBILIZATION BUTMENTIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION TO AGREE ON THECESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.   BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, CRISTIANI ISCLOSING THE DOOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION.  THIS, PLUS HIS REFUSAL TO REACHAN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN, MAKES HIM GUILTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THECOMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE AT ESQUIPULAS.   3.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMITMENT WE MADE IN MEXICO AND WITHTHE REGIONAL ACCORDS, WE REITERATE OUR FULL WILLINGNESS TO AGREE WITHTHE GOVERNMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AND TO ATTENDTHE UPCOMING NEGOTIATION MEETING IN COSTA RICA.  FOR THIS MEETING, WEHAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASEDON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OFREPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNORARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS;ENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OFTHE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OFTHE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEADOF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICALAREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.

ONE OFTHE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THECOMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, ANDSOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENTHAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  THESE DEMANDSARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMANRIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, ANDEFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDINGTORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCEAGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES AREDEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ANDSINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TOCONVERT THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER] INTO AN AGENCY OF THEARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BEUNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL.  JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFTAND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECTPHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE\\'S DEMANDSCONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN?   [INZUNZA] THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THENEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OFTHE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FORVICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY ANDCOMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OFCONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNINGTRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BYTHE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALLPOLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI.ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN,AND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THISWAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENTSTRIKE BY COAL MINERS.  THIS PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOODTHAT THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THEIRACTIVITIES AND A WAY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THEFUTURE STRUGGLE. [END RECORDING]   THE PRECEDING COMMENTS WERE MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADERJAIME INZUNZA, WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE ON OURPROGRAM \"ESCUCHA CHILE.\"  ANOTHER TOPIC DISCUSSED BY INZUNZA WAS THEEL MERCURIO REPORT ON THE CNI\\'S TRANSFER TO THE ARMY.  THE DISSOLUTIONOF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSEMAJORITY OF CHILEANS.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA,ON THE DICTATOR\\'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEPIT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND?   [INZUNZA] I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS.  THEINTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THEDICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANTVIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE.  IUNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACEDBY CNI] AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORETHE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.  IFTRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET\\'SORDERS.  UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?  FOR WHOM HASIT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS?  HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDERTHE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY. [ENDRECORDING]   COMMUNIST LEADER JAIME INZUNZA ADDED THAT PINOCHET\\'S INTENT INTRANSFERRING THE CNI TO THE ARMY\\'S DIRECT COMMAND IS TO MAKE THEINSTITUTION AN ACCOMPLICE IN CONCEALING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEENRESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [INZUNZA] THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARYINSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOTRESPONSIBLE.  THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCESWANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTSVIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE TRANSFER OFTHE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT ASACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES.  LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKEHERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OFCRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESEMEN.  THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THISTRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MANRESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATORHIMSELF.

THE STRIKE BY TEACHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A BONUS OF 300BOLIVIAN PESOS, HAS UNLEASHED VIOLENT STREET CONFRONTATIONS OVER THEPAST FEW DAYS AND AT LEAST FOUR BOMBINGS.   THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN BESIEGED BY A WAVE OF SOCIAL DEMANDSAND PRESSURED BY THE 80,000 TEACHERS, HAS STATED THAT THESEDEMONSTRATIONS ARE UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC STABILITY. IT ADDED THATDESPITE EFFORTS TO FIND A PATH TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND DIALOGUE,IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO PREVENT RADICAL GROUPS INTERESTED IN THEUNION LEADERSHIP FROM PUBLICLY CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT.

IGNORING A MARTIAL LAWPROHIBITING ALL TRAVEL, EARLY THIS MORNING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILYARMED SOLDIERS BURST INTO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRIESTS WHO MANAGE THEJOSE SIMEON CANAS CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY [UCA].  THE SOLDIERS BROKE INTOTHE PRIESTS\\' BEDROOMS, CAPTURED THEM, AND BRUTALLY MURDERED THEM INTHE GARDEN.   THE VICTIMS OF THIS HATEFUL COLLECTIVE CRIME WERE: PRIEST AND DRIGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE UCA DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR IGNACIO MARTINBARO, UCA DEPUTY DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR SEGUNDO MONTES, UCA HUMANRIGHTS INSTITUTE DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR AMANDO LOPEZ, UCA DEAN;PRIEST JUAN RAMON MORENO; AND JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, AS WELL AS JULIARAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELVA RAMOS.   THE PERSONS WHO ORDERED THE HORRIBLE MURDER OF THE JESUITS ANDTHREE SALVADORAN CITIZENS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ORDERED PILOTS,ARTILLERY MEN, AND MACHINEGUNNERS IN PLANES TO ATTACK THE CIVILIANPOPULATION.  THEY ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AGAINST REACHING APOLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.  THEY ARE THE TOPMILITARY AND POLITICAL FIGURES IN ALFREDO CRISTIANI\\'S ADMINISTRATION.

AN OFFENSIVE WAS LAUNCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY\\'STERRITORY; HOWEVER, SAN SALVADOR\\'S CITY BLOCKS, WHICH WERE THE SCENEOF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN FMLN DETACHMENTS AND GOVERNMENT TROOPS,WERE THE EPICENTER OF SUNDAY\\'S EVENTS.  THE INTENSE FIREFIGHTINVOLVING ARTILLERY AND HELICOPTERS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 18 HOURS ANDENCOMPASSED VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE CAPITAL, COMPLETELY PARALYZING LIFEIN THE CITY.  ACCORDING TO REUTER, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO STORMPRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI\\'S OFFICIAL AND PERSONAL RESIDENCES;HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT HURT.   REPORTS OF THE LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES ARE CONTRADICTORY.   A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN EL SALVADOR ANDCONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.  A CURFEW IS IN FORCEIN THE CAPITAL, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED.ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHOSE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST ON THERADIO, THESE STEPS ARE NEEDED TO \"DEFEND THE POPULATION AGAINSTLEFT-WING TERRORISM.\"  ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THE MILITARY ARE INCOMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED FROM SANSALVADOR THAT THESE WORDS BY A.  CRISTIANI WERE HEARD ON THE AIRWAVESACCOMPANIED BY CONTINUAL EXPLOSIONS AND SHOOTING.   INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS REGARD EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR IN THECONTEXT OF THE INTERRUPTED TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THEINSURGENTS.  THE THIRD ROUND OF THESE TALKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELDRECENTLY IN CARACAS, BUT OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES REFUSED TO TAKEPART IN THEM AFTER A LEFT-WING TRADE UNION\\'S HEADQUARTERS WASSUBJECTED TO ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST10 PEOPLE.  ACCORDING TO THE INSURGENTS, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ONDIALOGUE WITH THEM SOLELY OUT OF PROPAGANDA CONSIDERATIONS, WITH NOINTENTION OF REACHING ANY AGREEMENT.  SUNDAY\\'S OFFENSIVE WAS THUS ANATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONEDWITH.   IN THE OPINION OF OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EVENTS IN SAN SALVADORPRACTICALLY RULE OUT ALL HOPES OF SUCCESS FOR FUTURE TALKS BETWEEN THEGOVERNMENT AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSURGENTS.

WITH THEINFORMATION IT HAS, THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT POINT THE FINGER AT ANYONE.IT CANNOT ACCUSE ANYONE YET, BECAUSE THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCEIN THIS CASE.  WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN COOPERATEWITH US IF WE HELP THEM.  THERE MAY BE SOME WITNESSES, WHO MAY BEWILLING TO COOPERATE, BUT THEY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.

[REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I BELIEVE MUCH DEPENDS ON THE POSITION OF THEFMLN.  I HAVE LISTENED TO SEVERAL VERSIONS ALL THE WAY FROM DEMANDINGMY RESIGNATION TO ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINST ME TO FINISHEVERYTHING UP.  UNDER THESE TERMS, THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE ABOUT TOCREATE A NEW LEBANON, AND THEY ARE SAYING THE FMLN HAS CONTROL OVERCERTAIN LIBERATED AREAS IN THE CAPITAL.  HOWEVER, IF WE TALKED ABOUTTHE SITUATION RATIONALLY AND REASONABLY, THERE COULD BE [WORDINDISTINCT].   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]   [CRISTIANI] WELL, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE AIR FORCE SITUATION INTHE PAST.  THE AIR FORCE HAS ORDERS NOT TO BOMB AND NOT TO USE ITSWEAPONS AGAINST URBAN AREAS OF THE CAPITAL UNLESS IT HAS BEEN ABLE TODETECT AND ISOLATE A CLEAR FMLN TARGET.  IN THIS REGARD, AIR FORCEBOMBS WERE NOT USED UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN AIR FORCE PLANES WEREATTACKED FROM SOME SUGARCANE FIELDS NORTH OF THE 1533 LANDING STRIP[16-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION]...USE BOMBS TO STOP THE USE OF FMLNMORTARS.  THE AIR FORCE USED MACHINEGUNS [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE ONLYTIME THEY WERE USED WITHIN THE URBAN AREA, TO BE SURE THEY WERE NOTENDANGERING ANYONE, WERE TWO MORTARS INSTALLED IN THE SOCCER FIELD OFTHE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

[CONTINUED]TST3-MUC4-0063   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] A FASCISTIDEOLOGY HAS INFILTRATED THE WHITE HOUSE AND NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISEDBECAUSE IT COINCIDES WITH THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]IDEOLOGY.  THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE BOMBINGS AFTERCYNICALLY SAYING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEM.  HOWEVER, THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENTIS EVEN MORE HAIR-RAISING THAN THE DENIAL.  HEAR US WELL: THE U.S.GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT IT SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS\\' EFFORTS TOCRUSH THE OFFENSIVE WHICH HAS CAUSED SO MANY PERSONAL TRAGEDIES; AND ITPRAISED THE ARMY FOR DECREEING STRICT LAWS TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.   WE ALSO HEAR THE PET EXPRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS USING CIVILIANS TOPROTECT ITS FIGHTERS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING THE PEOPLE FROMTHEIR ENVIRONMENT IS UNSCRUPULOUSLY APPLIED ONCE MORE.  THIS IS WHYTHE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS DESTROYED, LEAVING ENTIRE TOWNSIN RUINS -- AND NOW LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY\\'S MOST IMPORTANT CITIESARE BEING DESTROYED.  ONE DAY THOSE RUINS WILL BECOME THE EVIDENCE WEWILL SHOW OUR CHILDREN TO PROVE THAT FASCISM ONCE EXISTED IN THECOUNTRY.   HOWEVER, THE U.S. IMPERIALISM\\'S CLUMSINESS GOES EVEN FURTHER.  THENORTH AMERICANS APPARENTLY WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A LARGE-SCALECONFLICT -- FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS WHO HAVE ALREADYEARNED THE WORLD\\'S SCORN -- GIVEN THE DECISION TO SEND U.S.  PILOTS TOBOMB THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY NIGHT.  THE FASCIST SALVADORANDICTATORSHIP HAS UNLEASHED THE BRUTAL TACTICS USED BY SOMOZA BEFORELEAVING POWER.  ON THAT OCCASION THE U.S. IMPERIALISM TURNED ITS BACKON THE TYRANT.   THE UNITED STATES\\' FOREIGN POLICY HAVE NEVER STOOPED SO LOW AND THEDECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT THEPOSSIBILITY OF A REGIONAL CONFLICT SO CLOSE.  WHAT DOES THE NICARAGUANGOVERNMENT THINK ABOUT THE AIRPLANES BEING FLOWN BY U.S.  PILOTS ONLYA FEW HUNDRED KM FROM ITS BORDER?  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF GUATEMALACONTINUES TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT?  THECONSEQUENCES ARE UNFORESEEABLE.  THE U.S. IMPERIALISM HAS SOILED ITSHANDS WITH A NEW GENOCIDE IN EL SALVADOR.  THE U.S. PEOPLE SHOULDDEEPLY REFLECT ABOUT THIS AND STOP THEIR GOVERNMENT FROM PROVOKINGCONTEMPT OF THAT NATION -- WHICH IS BEING DISINFORMED AND INTOXICATEDBY THE ANTI-COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.   LARGE GROUPS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\\'S PEOPLE, THE BEST SONS OF THEUNITED STATES, HAVE REACTED AND HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS --DEEPINSIDE THE U.S. IMPERIALISM\\'S HEART.  SOON, VERY SOON, THIS WILLBECOME AN UNSTOPPABLE SURGE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\\'S STRATEGIC GOAL ISCLEAR: THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS THESALVADORAN PEOPLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  TO QUOTE MONSIGNOR [OSCARARNULFO] ROMERO, THE ARMY -- AND IN THIS CASE THE NORTHAMERICANS -- ARE LIKE SERPENTS, WHICH ONLY BITE THE SHOELESS.

THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLISAND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTEBATTALION.   IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANARESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE,AND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENTNO. 6 OF SONSONATE.  TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SANSALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THECOUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THISMORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES.  WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT?  THE SONSONATESOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS GIVES US A GENERALPICTURE OF THE DEFEAT.  IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THELAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEENWIPED OUT.

IN FACT, AS THE NEWSPAPER SUGGESTS,THE YANKEE HAND IS TODAY IN EL SALVADOR AS IT WAS YESTERDAY INVIETNAM.  THE WOUNDED MOTHER WHO TRIES TO COMFORT HER DAUGHTER, AVICTIM OF THE BOMBINGS, IS NOT AN ISOLATED PICTURE.  IT IS A SYMBOL OFTHE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION INTHAT COUNTRY.   THE UNITED STATES IS NOT INNOCENT OF THESE CRIMES BECAUSE U.S.PILOTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACRE.  IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT ISTHE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION DOING?  IN FACT, HE IS DOING NOTHING THATCOULD NOT BE PREDICTED.  PRESIDENT BUSH GETS ON THE PHONE AND CALLSHIS SALVADORAN CRONY ALFREDO CRISTINI TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYTHING ISALL RIGHT, THAT HE CAN GO ON, THAT THE U.S.  POSITION IS FAVORABLE TOHIS REGIME.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THERECENT BRUTAL KILLINGS OF UNION LEADERS BY THE ARMY.  BUSH ASKS NOQUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF SPANISH PRIESTS.  THE PRESIDENT ONLYPRAISES THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE, THE POLICE AND PARAMILITARY EFFORTSTO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE.   BUSH AND CRISTIANI COULD NOT FAIL TO MENTION THE TRITE SLOGAN OFTHE CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN AID TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  NOR DIDBUSH FAIL TO EXPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\\'S SOLIDARITY.  BUT,SOLIDARITY WITH WHOM?  ALL WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT UP TO NOW ARE THEPROTESTS PROVOKED IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE U.S.  MILITARY AID TOTHE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE ONLY REALITIES ARE THE DEMONSTRATIONSSTAGED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. AID.  THEONLY FACT IS THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION IS BEING PUBLICLYQUESTIONED ABOUT THIS AID.  THE ONLY PICTURE THAT HAS BEENDISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERRUPTSBUSH\\'S SPEECH TO SHOUT TO HIM: WHY ARE WE SENDING MONEY TO ELSALVADOR? WHY ARE WE KILLING PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR?  IT IS NOTPOSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\\'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THECURRENT SALVADORAN SITUATION.

TST3-MUC4-0070   SAN SALVADOR, 26 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENTALFREDO CRISTIANI, IN PROGRESS] [TEXT] ...THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDOMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SALVADORANPEOPLE ON 11 NOVEMBER.  THE FMLN LAUNCHED THIS AGGRESSION WITH ALL OFITS FORCES, CHIEFLY USING A CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS AND FIGHTERS INTHE SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN ZONE, IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZDEPARTMENT, AND AT TIMES IN USULUTAN CITY, USULUTAN DEPARMENT, AND INSAN MIGUEL CITY, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.  IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLNDISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY.  IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS,WHICH....[CHANGES THOUGHT] BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORANARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE ITIS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADYFOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS.   IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU,SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THEIDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THEPEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM.  THEY HAVE REALIZED THATTHIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE.  FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THESALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES INTHE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION.   HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.  IT ISIMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORTFROM SOMEONE ABROAD.  ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THISSUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENTCASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREENIN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAYDEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEPUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA ANDCASTRO PARTICIPATE.  IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HASHAPPENED.  DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OFANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERSWHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TOCOLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS INTHE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADELAUNCHERS.   WHAT HAPPENED?  IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KINDOF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIALHOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES\\' JOINTCHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISONPARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  AS A RESULT OF THESAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED.  MOREOVER, LET USRECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THATTHE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN ANDEL SALVADOR.  ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTSMADE TO COSTA RICA.  IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FORCONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPENVIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS.   AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY?  ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE,TWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED.  THEIRFLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THEONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND.  AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE ADOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETATRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA\\'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINOAIRPORT.  IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN.  INTHAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WASWEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARYUNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANYCOUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE.  IT ISBELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD AWEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD.  HE KILLED HIMSELFBECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF IMPLICATED IN THIS SITUATION.

ACCORDING TO CHICA, THE FMLN LEADERS IN MANAGUA DECIDED TO LAUNCHTHE OFFENSIVE, TRUSTING THE UNTS LEADERS\\' REPORTS THAT CONDITIONS WERERIGHT FOR AN INSURRECTION BECAUSE FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ\\' DEATH INTHE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONALUNION FEDERATION] HAD IGNITED THE PEOPLE\\'S SPIRITS.  THEPRISONER SAID THAT THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT A SUMMARY TRIAL IN THE STYLEOF COMMUNIST PARTIES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE.

TST3-MUC4-0075   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE (RADIO CADENA CUSCATLAN) -- [TEXT] [NEWS CONFERENCEWITH SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR ANDREPORTERS] [CONTINUED] [MODERATOR] MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA, OF THE \"UP TODATE\" NEWSCAST.   [GUEVARA] HOW DO THE FIVE PRESIDENTS CONCEIVE THE DEMOBILIZATION OFTHE FMLN?  HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING?   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THISPRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS.  TO EXPLAINTHIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HASBEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY.  ON THISOCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WEWERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGSFROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUANPROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY.  WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRYCONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRYIN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORMMANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THEPRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS.   THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THEMEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEENGRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FORTHE FMLN.   WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF ANAGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD.  HERE INEL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBERTERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLYWITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OFINTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS.   IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THECAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THISDOCUMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION ANDPACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA.  IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULARGROUPS, BE IT THE URNG [GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY] INGUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAYTRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA.   WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALLTHE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATERUNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE INTHE REGION.   [MODERATOR] RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO.   [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOLMEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND.  IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENTORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THEDEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOROF NICARAGUA.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSOHOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOMEISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL?ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULTOF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON?   [CRISTIANI] IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WASUNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING AFACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMEDREVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATICPROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORINGTHE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESECOMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLEDEFENSE.   THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPTTHE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELFTOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES INPOLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.  TST3-MUC4-0076   CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]COMRADES: A NEW ELEMENT THAT WE MUST ANALYZE AND EXPLAIN EMERGED ATTHE CONCLUSION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS\\' EMERGENCY MEETING.LET US SEE FIRST WHY THE MEETING TOOK PLACE.  THE MAIN REASON IS THEVERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACEDCRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENTHAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THEBRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIANPOPULATION.  LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITEDNATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE,ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, ELSALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.   WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT ISTHAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THEDICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THISWAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.   TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONALORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTHAMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THEGENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT INSPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.   THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OFCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALLKNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESECOUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.   THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OFINTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.   UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRSTTHAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OFGUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECTOF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THISDOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATINAMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS,WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA-- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING-- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.  THE FMLN WAS NOT EVENALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.   HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED ANDIN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WASACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  ITWAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANIPREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THEHONDURAN PRESIDENT.   AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDALREGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THEBULL BY THE HORNS.   LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS.[CONTINUED]TST3-MUC4-0077   BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] IN VIEW OFTHE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TODAY IN WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SONFREDDY, AND SEVERAL OF HIS BODYGUARDS WERE KILLED, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCOTODAY CALLED AN URGENT COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATIONAND RECEIVE A FULL REPORT FROM MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES.

[MAZA] BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED ALONG WITHTHE NATIONAL POLICE EVER SINCE THE ATTACK OCCURRED POINT IN THATDIRECTION.

FURTHERMORE, THISMAN WAS IN THERE CELEBRATING THE GENOCIDE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED INBOGOTA.   [REPORTER] [QUESTION INDISTINCT]   [MAZA] BECAUSE THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THIS, ANDACCORDING TO CERTAIN STATEMENTS WE HAVE, HE WAS OVERJOYED BY THEDAMAGE THAT HE HAD CAUSED IN THE CITY GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLEWHO WERE KILLED; SEEING HIM SUNBATHING AND SWIMMING ON THE ATLANTICCOAST LED US TO BELIEVE THIS.

IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDEDTO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TOMAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL.PERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OFPROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILETHE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTEDIN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACASON 28 MARCH 1954.

THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSYHAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TOENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED.  WE HAVE TALKEDWITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FORCONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT.  I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITHTHE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA.   I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS:   [REPORTER] MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THEPEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICALREFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS.  WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?   [LARCO COX] THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS.  WEHAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES.  WEHAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA ORTHE UNITED STATES.  OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEMARE FACING ANY TRIALS.  THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD.  WE SEE THISAS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA.   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT?   [LARCO COX] IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHATTHEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.  ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS,CHARGE D\\'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATIONTHAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT.  THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOTMADE ANY DECLARATIONS.  HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS INPANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKINGRETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  HE COULD NOT THINK OFANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FORALLEGED STATEMENTS.  SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATIONBECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB.  BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGINGTO ONE OF THE EMBASSY\\'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE ISNO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.   [REPORTER] ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS ISDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION?   [LARCO COX] YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.   [REPORTER] IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OFITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA?   [LARCO COX] WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLINGA HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE.  OUR FIRSTRESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM ISRESPECTED.

LAST WEEK, THE STATE COUNCIL, COLOMBIA\\'S HIGHEST LEGAL ANDADMINISTRATIVE BODY, HAD ACCREDITED BERNARDO JARAMILLO AS UP\\'SPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.   BEFORE MAKING HIS CANDIDACY EFFECTIVE, BERNARDO JARAMILLO TOLD EFETHAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO BECOME \"THE WILL OF A WIDE AND DEMOCRATICSECTOR OF THE PEOPLE AND AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL COLOMBIANBIPARTISANSHIP.\"  HE ADDED: \"OUR MOVEMENT WANTS TO TRANSCEND THELIMITS OF THE UP AND OBTAIN FOLLOWERS FROM OTHER SECTORS OF THEDEMOCRATIC LEFT WHO SUPPORT NEW GOVERNMENT ALTERNATIVES.\"   HE DID NOT REJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT UP AND THE 19TH APRILMOVEMENT (M-19), A REBEL MOVEMENT THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO JOIN THECOUNTRY\\'S LEGAL POLITICAL SYSTEM, WILL PRESENT JOINT ELECTORAL TICKETSIN SOME REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY.   \"THERE IS NOTHING CONCRETE ON THIS,\" HE ADDED, \"BUT IT COULD BE ANALTERNATIVE IF THEY PROPOSE IT.\"   UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA STATED THAT \"OUR PARTY\\'S MAIN OBJECTIVEIN THESE ELECTIONS IS TO BREAK THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVEHEGEMONY.\"  THESE TWO SECTORS HAVE SHARED POWER DURING COLOMBIA\\'SENTIRE REPUBLICAN PERIOD.   \"WE PRESENT OUR CANDIDATE TO OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS WITH THEHOPE THAT HIS CANDIDACY WILL BE BACKED AND THAT WE CAN CREATE A NEWAND WIDER FORCE WITH POSSIBILITIES OF ATTAINING VICTORY,\" HE NOTED.

TST3-MUC4-0083   CLANDESTINE, 31 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERALCOMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT]CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS FOR THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION BASED ON THEMEDIATION OF UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR AND THEDEBATE IN THE U.S.  CONGRESS ON THE AID TO EL SALVADOR, THE FARABUNDOMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] REPORTS:   1.  WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY\\'S REJECTIONMR PEREZ DE CUELLAR\\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS ASA MEDIATOR.  THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATETHE NEGOTIATION EFFORT.  ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WEHAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT.   2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATICLEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS INTHE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THEPOLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THEPERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THEDIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI\\'S GOVERNMENTIS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY\\'SSOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES.  FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THEDIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNEDINTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES.   3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICYBASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN\\'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS.  THIS POSITION,SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER [DATE OF THEBEGINNING OF THE FMLN MILITARY OFFENSIVE] WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TOGREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION.   4. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE MEETING OF BOTH SIDESWITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SOON.  WE HOPE THAT MR CRISTIANI\\'S VISITTO THE UNITED NATIONS WILL LEAD TO SUCH A MEETING AND THAT WE CANAGREE WITH THE MEDIATOR ON THE DATE TO HOLD IT.   5.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT ISDIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.  THESENDING OF SIGNALS TO ONE OR ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ARMY,USING THE PRESSURE OF SETTING CONDITIONS OR THREATENING THE END OFAID, DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S.CONGRESS CAN MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO END THE WAR IN OURCOUNTRY BY AGREEING TO SUSPEND THAT AID, SOMETHING WHICH COULD FORMPART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL ACEASE-FIRE.   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND   COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, FRANCISCOJOVEL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS   30 JANUARY 1990 TST3-MUC4-0084   SAN SALVADOR, 2 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] IT WAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCEDTODAY THAT SIX SALVADORAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF CLASHESWITH SALVADORAN REBELS IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST FEWHOURS.  MEANWHILE, IT WAS ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE REBELS ATTACKEDMILITARY POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR, BLEW UP A STORE, AND BURNED APUBLIC BUS.   THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) REPORTED THAT THEFARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND MEMBERS OF THE4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE MET IN HEAVY CLASHES IN THE HAMLET OF EL ZUNGANO,IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ONTHE AFTERNOON OF 1 FEBRUARY.  SIX SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OFTHE CLASHES.  COPREFA ADDED THAT SEVERAL GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED ORWOUNDED.   IN ADDITION, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN, AN ARMED GROUP THAT HASBEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, HARASSED TWONATIONAL GUARD POSTS LAST NIGHT.  THE POLICE REPORTED THAT A POWERFULBOMB WENT OFF AT AN ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE STORE IN DOWNTOWN SANSALVADOR THIS MORNING, BUT CAUSING ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE.  TST3-MUC4-0085   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 FEB 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY][TEXT] SMARTLY DRESSED AND SPEAKING IN NEARLY PERFECT ENGLISH,SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS AGAIN VISITED THE UNITEDSTATES, WHERE HE TRIED TO APPEAR AT THE CONGRESS AND THE UNITEDNATIONS AS A STATESMAN AWARE OF HIS RIGHTS.   THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT,AND HE KNOWS IT.  BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGENUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S.  CITY HEVISITED.  ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIMALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEWTO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLYTHE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE ANDCHECK THE ARMY\\'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAGHAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSEHE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVEWASHINGTON\\'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.   ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HISPREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THERESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARYOFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELYEIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WEMUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENTSUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS.MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THATNEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TOSUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THEGUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY\\'SINTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICHEVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THEGOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THEEYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSODEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IFSERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCYPOLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES APRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY.   ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID ELSALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEENQUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THESALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR.  IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THEALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR ORRESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THESITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUSTENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TOINFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEINGTHE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HISPARTY.  THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRYIMMERSED IN WAR.  IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ISEVEN WEAKER.  ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AIDFOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTOTHE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR.

GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO\"INTIMIDATE AND MURDER\" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING.   GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THEELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVEDEPLOYED.   \"EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WASFREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES,\" HE SAID.

THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN ELPARAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BYTHE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVEANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATIONOF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.   \"THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATINGCONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOINCIVIC LIFE,\" HE ADDED.

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWWHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT, SINCE SOME SUPPORT HAVING PRIMARY MEETINGSAND THEN A SUMMIT, SO TO SPEAK?   [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM.  WESAID THAT THE RESUMPTION OF THE TALKS MUST TAKE PLACE WHEN THE FMLNENTERS THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH A SERIOUS ATTITUDE.  WE MAINTAIN OURSTANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY ANDINDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIESTHE FMLN CONDUCTS.  THIS IS A SMALL REQUEST THAT OBTAINED THE SUPPORTOF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE SAN ISIDRO CORONADOMEETING IN COSTA RICA.   I THINK THAT THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE ASKED FORCHANGES IN FORMAT, AND WE SAID WE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THEREQUESTS WE HAVE RECEIVED.  WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR THE FMLN, SINCETHEY ASKED FOR TIME TO ANALYZE THINGS A LITTLE BEFORE HAVING THEMEETING.  WE ARE AWAITING THE VISIT OF MR. DE SOTO IN EARLY MARCH.OBVIOUSLY, THE DIALOGUE HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOMEDIFFERENCES, [WORDS INDISTINCT].  I THINK THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THATTHE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO AGREE TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIONS, AND THAT ISWHY THERE IS NO DIALOGUE NOW.   [MODERATOR] EPIGMENIO IBARRA.   [IBARRA] MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA SAIDAT A RALLY THAT HE WILL WAGE A CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION.  HE SAID THATTHE REVOLUTION DID NOT DIE WITH THE ELECTIONS.  HE SAID THAT THESANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WESENSE A PRETTY COMPLEX CLIMATE FOR THE TRANSITION IN NICARAGUA.  WHATDO YOU THINK ABOUT DANIEL ORTEGA\\'S STATEMENTS?  HOW DO YOU VIEW THEPOSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE A TRUE TRANSITION FROM POWER TO POWERINSTEAD OF A TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA?   [CRISTIANI] AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, STATEMENTS BY ORTEGA AND OTHERREPRESENTATIVES OF THE SANDINIST FRONT ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN.  THEYCOULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST,BUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ISCONCERNED.  THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELYPICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEMBEST.  I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TOTHE FSLN.  THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION INNICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA.  THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUSEXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION.  THE FSLNHAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION.   I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEENTHE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO [NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION], THATIS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN.  YET, THEPEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTSTHAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DOTHAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY.  LET ME REPEAT: THERE ISNOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY.  THEARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY\\'S DEMOCRATICPROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY.  WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVENOT BEEN SETTLED YET.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGSLEFT PENDING.

THAT IS WHAT IT WANTS TO DO, BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR LARGECOUNTRIES TO SEE COUNTRIES LIKE GUATEMALA, WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OFAUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE, ACHIEVE HISTORIC SUCCESSES BY SHOWING THATOUR COUNTRY IS RIGHT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CERTAIN U.S. GROUPS.

ITADDED THAT EVER SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS ACCORD, GUATEMALAHAS RECEIVED $600 MILLION IN U.S. AID.  THIS SHOWS, ACCORDING TO THEEMBASSY, THAT U.S. SUPPORT FOR GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY CONTINUED TO BESTRONG AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENT.   IN ANY CASE, FROM PRESIDENT CEREZO\\'S PERSPECTIVE THE U.S.  ATTITUDEIN THIS SITUATION REFLECTS THE TRADITIONAL INCLINATION OF THATCOUNTRY\\'S GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO DICTATE RULES TO OTHERNATIONS REGARDING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.  CEREZO COMPARED GUATEMALA\\'SSITUATION IN MATTERS OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO THE SITUATION INSEVERAL U.S. CITIES WHERE THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL CRIME.  ASAN EXAMPLE, HE CITED WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE ASSAULTS, MURDERS, ANDCRIMES FREQUENTLY RELATED TO DRUG CONSUMPTION HAVE REACHED VERYASTONISHING LEVELS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.   AS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF AMBASSADOR STROOK, CEREZO SAID THAT THEDIPLOMAT HAS NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM GUATEMALA, BUT RETURNED TO THEUNITED STATES FOR CONSULTATIONS BY ORDER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT.  INSTATEMENTS MADE MINUTES AFTER RECEIVING THE CREDENTIALS OF THE NEW FRGAMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, CEREZO SAID THAT HIS RETURN WAS, TO A CERTAINEXTENT, DUE TO A DECISION WE MADE.

TST3-MUC4-0098   SAN SALVADOR, 7 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [REPORT] [JULIOERNESTO RODRIGUEZ] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANISTATED TODAY THAT IT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM FOR THE FOURTH PENAL JUDGE,WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE OF THE JESUITS MURDERED BY A GROUP OFSOLDIERS, TO ORDER THAT CADETS WHO ARE TAKING COURSES ABROAD RETURN TOTHE COUNTRY.  IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHOTESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAININGCOURSES ABROAD.  IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY SCHOOL\\'SREGISTRATION BOOK FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE PREMISES HADBEEN LOST, INCLUDING THE PAGES THAT CORRESPOND TO NOVEMBER 1989.TODAY, CRISTIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND SAID THE JUDGE SHOULDCONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND NOT JUST MAKE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THEPROBLEMS.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEMIN THE OFFICERS RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IF A JUDGE ORDERS THAT THEYCOME TO TESTIFY.  ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMONTHEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT,RETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES.  GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLYSENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL;THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROMALL ARMED FORCES UNITS.   CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT.  IBELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUETO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE.  TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY AREBROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUSTTESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE?  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  [ENDRECORDING]   THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TODAY AT THE EL SALVADOR MILITARY AIRPORTBEFORE HE LEFT FOR COSTA RICA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OFPRESIDENT-ELECT RAFAEL CALDERON FOURNIER.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THEUNITED STATES CONDITIONING 50 PERCENT OF THE AID GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRYCOULD CAUSE THE REBEL FRONT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS.  HE ACCUSED THEFMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OF USING DIALOGUE FORTACTICAL REASONS.   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAVE STATED THAT AN ACTION OF THISTYPE WOULD BE VERY UNTIMELY, AS IT COULD MAKE THE MOST RADICAL FMLNMEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND, THUS, HINDER THE DIALOGUEPROCESS.   [REPORTER] HOWEVER, [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESSURE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM[WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH FMLN.   [CRISTIANI] I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION: WHO HAS ALWAYS SHOWEDGOODWILL AND SINCERELY SOUGHT AN AGREEMENT AND WHO HAS NOT DONE THIS?HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS USED THE PROPOSALS BY[JOSE NAPOLEON] DUARTE\\'S GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN FOR TACTICAL REASONS.IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOVERNMENTS.  I BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN MUSTUNDERSTAND AND BE PRESSURED TO REALLY SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION.[END RECORDING]   ALSO TODAY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AUTHORIZED A SPOKESMAN TOANNOUNCE THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN WILL BE RENEWED ON16 MAY.  THE PANORAMA THAT SURROUNDS THIS NEW ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER,PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM MEETINGS IN THE PAST,BECAUSE BOTH SECTORS HAVE MET WITH POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED ATTHE [WORD INDISTINCT].  FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTDONE THE SAME WITH THE COUNTRY\\'S SOCIAL FORCES, THE REBELS WILL TRY TODO SO THIS WEEK.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROMTHE DIALOGUE COULD BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OBTAINED DURINGPAST NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BECOMEINVOLVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE NEGOTIATING DEMAND THAT THEAGREEMENTS ATTAINED BE BASED ON INTERNAL COOPERATION.

POWERFUL FORCES ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFYVIOLENCE AND WAR EVERY TIME DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS OR COMMITMENTS ARE NOTFOLLOWED OR MET.   WHEN THERE IS AN ARMED STRUGGLE AND WHEN THOUSANDS ARE KILLED ONTHE BATTLEFIELD, THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE NEVER CONCLUDE FROM THOSEUSELESS KILLINGS THAT WAR IS FUTILE. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEACECAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION.   IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASIER TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHEN THE WEAKNESSESARE POLITICAL OR WHEN ERRORS ARE MADE ON THE ROAD TO PEACE. WE CANNOTBRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE, AND VIOLENCE BORN OF HATRED TAKES A LONGTIME TO HEAL.   I BELIEVE, MR PRESIDENT, THAT IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING IF YOU WERETO RECTIFY SOME POLITICAL DECISIONS YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE FOLLOWING THEUNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS AT NANDAIME.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN THECOMMUNICATIONS MEDIA THAT ARE CLOSED. IT IS NECESSARY TO RELEASE THEPRISONERS AND TO REVOKE THE SENTENCES IMPOSED UPON THEM AS PUNISHMENTFOR INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE INCIDENTS.  THE PEACE PLAN TO WHICH WE ARECOMMITTED OBLIGES US TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OURMOST SACRED COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING ON THE PATH TOWARDDEMOCRATIZATION.   IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRASRESUME NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE A PERMANENT END TO MILITARY ACTIONS INNICARAGUA. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE AN ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE FOR MANYCENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. I OFFER YOU OUR COSTA RICANTERRITORY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. I ALSO OFFER YOUALL THE ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY MEANS TO ENABLE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKEPLACE.   I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ATTEND THE UPCOMING INAUGURAL CEREMONYIN ECUADOR. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTUREOF PEACE, A NOBLE GESTURE TOWARD RODRIGO BORJA, AND WOULD AID INSTRENGTHENING THE ECUADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF YOU ATTENDED THECEREMONY IN QUITO AFTER REVERSING THE SETBACKS INCURRED AS A RESULT OFANTIDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS PENALIZING THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIAAND DEPRIVING MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR LIBERTY.   ONLY IF WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CORRECT OUR MISTAKES AND THE VISIONTO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE PEACE PLAN CAN CENTRALAMERICANS PREVENT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST OURPEOPLES.

THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE ANDCORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THEDISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE FDP HAVE BECOME AMAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEENDISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS.   BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA ISPROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT ISRUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULYRESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGAREMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIETINTERVENTION.  THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BYNORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERSAND THEIR FAMILIES.   NORIEGA\\'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM.TO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVENORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT ANINTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY.   THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOWWHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S.CITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPSTHAT WERE CAPTURED.   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FORMISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE.IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKEDON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED.   GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USETHEM.  WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS AVIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WEWENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WASBECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPSTHAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSEWHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIANPEOPLE\\'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FORSUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THECASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRALAMERICA.   WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEPAHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULDRESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES.   WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELLARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEENWORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKEKINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKINGCHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT.

THE FMLN\\'S STRATEGY IS SIMPLY TO INCREASE ITS TERRORISTACTIONS.   FOR THAT REASON, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENTDESCRIBES THE FMLN AS A GROUP IN ARMS, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELYTERRORIST CRIMINALS.

OF THIS OCCASION THEY DISCUSSED THE LINE THAT THE TERRORISTORGANIZATION SHOULD FOLLOW. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OFAN \"ARMED REBELLION,\" WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THEN.

HE SAID THAT THE MONTHS OF TRUCE WERE USED TO FULFILL THESENEEDS.

[BARCO] I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THECOMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING.  THE QUESTIONARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTEDBY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES.  THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARECOMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY AREYOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALLPOLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOTFOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES.   THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED--MAY I ADD ON ANINDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL BASIS--IN ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AREUNDER INVESTIGATION, WILL BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY COURT, ANDMANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXPELLED.

I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATICPROCESS WILL BE STRENGTHENED. I BELIEVE THE MINDS OF MEN WILL BETRANSFORMED POSITIVELY, AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES--EVEN THE MOSTPOLARIZED ONES--WILL BE DEFINITELY SOLVED BY THE CIVILIZED MEANS OFTHE ELECTORAL PROCESS.   I CALL ON ALL POLITICAL PARTIES TO STRENGTHEN THE CURRENT POLITICALPROCESS AND PUT THE SACRED INTERESTS OF THE NATION BEFORE ANY OTHERINTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THE REPUBLIC ANDCONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELONGS TO ALL SALVADORANS.   I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A CALL TO ALL GROUPS SO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS,WHICH WILL CULMINATE WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR,DEVELOPS WITH THE SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR THAT CORRESPONDS TO COURAGEOUSPEOPLE, WHO WISH TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR POLITICAL MATURITY AND THEIRDESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE.

THECOMMUNIST PARTY, WHICH HAS HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CASUALTIES ANDMISSING AND TORTURED PEOPLE SINCE THE DICTATORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED,CONTINUES TO BE BANNED.

THIS DEFICIT IN ANDEAN TRADE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED SINCE1982, WHEN THE FOREIGN DEBT CRISIS EXPLODED IN ANDEAN GROUP COUNTRIES,IS CAUSED BY THE FALL BY ALMOST 23 PERCENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS, WHICH IN1988 TOTALED $3.847 BILLION.   THIS DEFICIT IS ALSO CAUSED BY AN INCREASE OF 18 PERCENT IN ANDEANIMPORTS FROM EEC COUNTRIES, WORTH $4.113 BILLION.

[VIDES] GOOD MORNING.   [REPORTER] VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE PEOPLE AREEXTREMELY WORRIED. WHAT ARE THE ARMED FORCES DOING TO GUARANTEE THEPEOPLE\\'S WELFARE?   [VIDES] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\\'S CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED TERRORISTVIOLENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TERRORIST ACTSALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE EXPECTED. THIS DOES NOTHAPPEN ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY; WE RECENTLY SAW IT IN SEOUL, BEFORE THEOLYMPICS, WHEN GROUPS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE THE AUTHORITIESAND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT FROM TAKING PLACE.   AN OAS MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY IN A FEWDAYS. THE EVENT IS BEING THREATENED BY A NUMBER OF ACTS, PARTICULARLYTERRORIST ACTS IN THE SAN BENITO, MAX DIAZ, ESCALON, AND SAN FRANCISCONEIGHBORHOODS.  THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WILL PROTEST AGAINSTTHE OAS MEETING IF THEY CAUSE TERROR IN THOSE AREAS.   WE ARE EXPECTING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM LATIN AMERICA, CENTRALAMERICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WHOM THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE WILL CALLOFF THE MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS THEMAIN REASON FOR THE INCREASED VIOLENCE.   YOU HAVE SEEN THAT WE HAVE INCREASED PATROL OPERATIONS RECENTLY.PATROLS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT AROUND THE VOLCANOES NEAR SANSALVADOR. SECURITY MEASURES ARE ALSO BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THEPERIPHERY OF SAN SALVADOR AND AROUND THE MEETING VENUE, BUT I CANNOTGIVE YOU THE DETAILS. THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THEOFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING.   WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM.HOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYSTHE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOTNECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREAOF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFFAN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA.   [REPORTER] GENERAL, THE FMLN\\'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SOOVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAININGCONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN\\'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN ITIS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES?   [VIDES] WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANYCIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLYVISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUPMEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT ATTHE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORANGOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVEFAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OURLARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT ANDUSULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY.   THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS.  HOWEVER,THE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIRFIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORISTACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERALUPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS.   THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOPTHEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVEFAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS.  THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMASHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT.   THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHTNOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASSA RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT.   FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATICPROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE AREDEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS,WHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.

ODDLYENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OFTHE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE\"MINI-ADJUSTMENT.\"  HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZEDBUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIRDEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER\"ECONOMIC AGENTS\" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT.THE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE \"NOT HAVING TO COMPETEWITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY INCIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEYARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF.\" IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TOITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND \"BURN UP\" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ONHIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY.  \"I\\'M THINKINGABOUT DEVALUATIONS (OF THE PESO) SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THISYEAR.\"   OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY   IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THEEXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES (WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE) \"CONSTITUTE ANEXPLOSIVE SITUATION,\" WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILLNOT IGNORE. BECAUSE \"IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, ITIS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION.\" AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVENMORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENTRISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLSFOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. AHIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT \"IT IS VALID TO AIM FORAN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TOBE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVYCONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH.\"   ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT\\'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADYVISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THATTHE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCEIT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MOREPOPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS.SIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI\\'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO AREADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUTIGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.  GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE ANINCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE (\"TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIGHER PAY INPRIVATE ENTERPRISE\") AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT (THE RUMOR OF A CUTTO 12 PERCENT WAS ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS BEFORE THE PLEBISCITE) ANDIN THE TAX ON CAPITAL.  BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILLSTRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION:\"REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAMETIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENTFROM THIS ONE.\" IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER.

WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE REPRESSIVE WAR THE ARMY HAS BEENWAGING AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE POPULATION HASREACHED LEVELS OF EXTREME CRUELTY, INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGSAND THE USE OF DEFOLIANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES WHERE CIVILIANS LIVE.

HE WAS APPARENTLY SHOT.   THE INDIVIDUAL WAS IDENTIFIED AS AN ALLEGED MEMBER OF THE PERUVIANCOMMUNIST PARTY, WITH ENTRIES IN POLICE RECORDS.   A POSTER WHICH READ \"AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

THESELF-STYLED MOR CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KILLING.TST4-MUC4-0089   SANTIAGO, 10 NOV 88 (QUE PASA) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED]   VARYING INTENTIONS   THE PROGRAM FOR LEGAL ACTION CERTAINLY RAISES DIFFERENTEXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PARTNERS IN IU. THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THATIN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME ISRUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUTIT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGSARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN.   CHRISTIAN LEFT [IC] WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THERESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALEDTHAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEWPOLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHOWERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD [PARTY FOR DEMOCRACY]: THEY HAVE TO DECIDEBETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH.  THIS ISSOMETHING THAT MAPU [UNITED POPULAR ACTION MOVEMENT]-BARRUETO IS NOTADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKEPART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO[SOCIALIST COMMAND FOR THE NO] OR LEFTIST PARTY.   THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEYCONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY.   THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY [PS]-ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THEMOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TOSET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THATTHIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OFLIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THESOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY.   PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29OCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY,IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THENUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALISTGROUP.  OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY INTHE \"SOCIALIST SPACE,\" BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT,MAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, INOTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TOSOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE.   THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISEDAT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN \"SACRIFICE\" OFPREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS.   THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A \"CONSENSUS\" VOTE, OF WHOSEPUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE WAS TALK OF\"THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THESOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THEPROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TOUNLEGALIZED PARTIES.\" THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WASCLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WINGALLIANCE. THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.   WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF \"THE MORETHAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS\" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TOSOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOWFOCUSING ON THIS.

WE REBELS HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED PEACE HIGHLY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVEALWAYS CLEARLY REITERATED THIS IDEA. TO SET THE PROPER FRAME OF MIND,WE WILL RECALL WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LA URIBE AGREEMENT ON 28 MARCH1984:   \"TO ENSURE PEACE IN THE NATION--WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITEFOR THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE\\'S PROSPERITY--AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT BASED ON LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, THE FOLLOWING IS HEREBYAGREED UPON.   \"1.

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COLOMBIANS SAID THESE ACCORDSBETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAD BECOME THE COUNTRY\\'S NEWPOLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.   THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR USELESS RECRIMINATIONS, BUT FOR A SERIOUSEFFORT TO DETERMINE WHO IS TO BLAME BECAUSE THE ACCORDS WENT PARTIALLYUNFULFILLED.

THE APRA CONGRESS ELIMINATED THE POST OF PARTY PRESIDENT, WHICH WASCREATED FOR ALAN GARCIA IN 1985, CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AS PARTYLEADER FOLLOWING A DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OFTHAT YEAR.   ACCORDING TO SOME CRITICS WITHIN THE PARTY, THE PERSONALISM THATHAD CHARACTERIZED GARCIA\\'S UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP SINCE 1982 WAS THUSENDED.   LUIS ALVA CASTRO, 46, FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND ECONOMY MINISTER ASWELL AS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WAS ELECTED BY ALARGE MARGIN AS THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL, A POST WHICH REGAINED THEHIGHEST STATUS IN THE PARTY. ALVA CASTRO CAPITALIZED ON THE INTERNALDISSIDENCE AND ON THE PARTY\\'S DISENCHANTMENT WITH ALAN GARCIA AS ARESULT OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION,WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST CRISIS IN THIS CENTURY AND IS BLAMED ONTHE CHIEF OF STATE\\'S \"STUBBORNNESS\" IN NOT CHANGING HISNATIONALISTIC AND POPULIST POLICY LINE.\"   THE NEW CADRE ELECTED AT THE 16TH APRA CONGRESS IS IN FAVOR OF A\"CHANGE IN ORIENTATION\" IN THE PARTY\\'S MANAGEMENT AND IN THE PUBLICADMINISTRATION FOR THE REMAINING 18 MONTHS OF THE APRA\\'S TERM INOFFICE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALAN GARCIA AND ALVA CASTRO MAY REACH ANAGREEMENT ON THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RUN UNTIL 1990, WHEN THECURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM WILL END FOLLOWING NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS.   GARCIA ALSO LOST THE PRESIDENCY OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION THATSETS THE PARTY\\'S POLITICAL LINE. THIS POST WAS WON BY LUIS ALBERTOSANCHEZ, 88, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATION AND ONE OF THEMAINSPRINGS IN THE CHANGEOVER OPERATION WITHIN THE APRA.   THE OTHER ELECTIVE POSITIONS WERE FILLED WITH APRA MEMBERS WHO DONOT FOLLOW GARCIA\\'S LINE. THUS, THE PRESENCE OF ALAN GARCIA WITHIN THEPARTY WAS REDUCED TO BEING MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION IN HISCAPACITY AS FORMER PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL.   TWO DAYS AGO, THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE RESIGNED THE APRAPRESIDENCY, UPSET OVER CRITICISM DIRECTED AT HIM DURING THE OPENING OFTHE PARTY CONGRESS. HE THUS RESPONDED TO OBVIOUS SIGNS THAT THE PARTYPRESIDENT POST WOULD BE ELIMINATED.   THE APRA HAD THOUGHT ALAN GARCIA WOULD BE A VERY CAPABLE HEIR TOVICTOR RAUL HAYA DE LA TORRE, THE PARTY\\'S FOUNDER AND HISTORICALLEADER, WHO DIED IN 1979. THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS AFTER GARCIA\\'SELECTION VICTORY, THE PARTY DISQUALIFIED GARCIA FOR THE ROLE OF HAYADE LA TORRE\\'S SUCCESSOR BECAUSE OF HIS ERRORS AND HIS FAILURE TORECTIFY HIS GOVERNMENT LINE.   FOLLOWING THE TRADITION INITIATED BY ALAN GARCIA, NEW APRA LEADERLUIS ALVA CASTRO WILL BE SWORN IN AS SECRETARY GENERAL THIS COMINGFRIDAY BEFORE THE TOMB OF HAYA DE LA TORRE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OFTRUJILLO, THE APRA\\'S MAIN BASTION.

THE SECOND\\nIMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARY\\nORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE\\nUNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BE\\nABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL.\\n\\n   THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.  ACCORDING TO THE\\nTIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DID\\nEXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM.\\n\\n   NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE.\\nRATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.  THEREFORE,\\nSINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS A\\nREPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT.  WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THE\\nTIAR.  THIS MUST BE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE\\nCALLED A SPECIAL SESSION.\\n\\n   [REPORTER] SEVERAL SECTORS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW\\nTHE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AS A HASTY DECISION.\\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] I THINK THAT THOSE MUST BE SECTORS COMMITTED TO THE\\nINVASION.  THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITED\\nSTATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDE\\nWHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT.\\n\\n   AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE AND\\nBLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION.\\nTHERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIAN\\nTERRITORY.  THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW\\nGOVERNMENT.  THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG AS\\nTHIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOT\\nSTAY IN THAT COUNTRY.  THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; IT\\nREPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE.\\n\\n   AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILL\\nKEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE.  AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT\\nWITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN AND\\nPERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER.\\n\\n   [REPORTER] DON\\'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAIN\\nRELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN\\'T IT JEOPARDIZE THE\\nIMF LOAN?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] NOT AT ALL.  THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\\nTHE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONAL\\nPOLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC AND\\nMILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE.\\n\\n   BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.  AS FOR\\nPANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN\\nACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WHEN ELECTIONS TOOK\\nPLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATES\\nDECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGE\\nFRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACE\\nNICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER.  THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITO\\nWERE THE AMERICANS.  ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA.\\n\\n   IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HIS\\nPLACE.  THE AMERICANS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DEL VALLE AS PRESIDENT.\\nTHEREFORE, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NORIEGA\\'S ACCOMPLICE IN\\nDEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY.  WE DENOUNCED THIS.  NORIEGA IS A\\nCREATION OF THE UNITED STATES.  IT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN SAID THAT\\nNORIEGA WORKED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THE U.S.  CENTRAL\\nINTELLIGENCE AGENCY, WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS ONCE CHIEF.\\n\\n   THEREFORE, NOW THAT THE MAID IS ANSWERING BACK, MAKING CLAIMS TO\\nTHE PANAMA CANAL AND WANTING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM THE UNITED\\nSTATES, THE UNITED STATES SUDDENLY DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS A DRUG\\nTRAFFICKER AND THAT SHE DOES NOT SERVE ITS INTERESTS, SO THEY SEND\\n30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS TO PANAMA.  THIS IS AN ABUSE.  IT IS A VIOLATION\\nOF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANOTHER STATE.\\n\\n   NO HONORABLE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY SHOULD TOLERATE THIS INVASION\\nWITHOUT ACTIVELY AND OPENLY CONDEMNING IT.  ONE WAY TO CONDEMN IT AND\\nEXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OF IT IS TO SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE TROOPS\\nINVADING LATIN AMERICA REMAIN, WE DO NOT NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR\\nAMBASSADOR THERE.

THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]\\nLEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE\\nONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS\\' MURDER CASE COULD BE\\nCLEARED-UP.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION [ARMED\\nFORCES] THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.  REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS\\nMEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR\\nPOLITICAL REASONS.  HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE\\nARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT\\nOUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS.  IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE\\nPASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN\\nON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD\\nTO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE\\nHAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. [END RECORDING]\\n\\n   D\\'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN\\nCLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE\\nCONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] THE JESUITS\\' CASE WAS A DETERMINING\\nFACTOR.  BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF\\nTHE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS\\nIS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS.  I DO NOT\\nBELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY\\nAFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].  FOR ARGUMENT\\'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID\\nARISE [WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED], THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN.  I\\nKNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE\\nDISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS.\\nFOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE\\nNEIGHBORHOODS.  WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY\\nCAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM\\nOF CIVILIANS WOUNDED.  FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE\\nTHINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE\\nTHEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. [END RECORDING]\\n\\n   THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\\nPRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF.  ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS\\nAGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE\\nMILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS\\' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN\\nTHE PARTY.  D\\'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [D\\'AUBUISSON] NOT IN THE LEAST.  THERE HAVE NEVER\\nBEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE\\nARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE\\nMAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING.  THIS IS REASON FOR\\nPRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY\\nAND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTRAS WERE A MERCENARY FORCE\\nMAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ATTACKED NICARAGUA FROM\\nHONDURAS, AND WHICH SHOULD AND COULD BE DEMOBILIZED.  IT IS CLEAR THAT\\nTHE FMLN IS A NATIONAL FORCE THAT HAS REASONS FOR BEING AT WAR, AND\\nWITH WHICH PEACE MUST BE NEGOTIATED.

TODAY\\nBOTH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED\\nTHE CRASH, BUT THEY REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THE AMERICANS WHO\\nWERE KILLED WERE CIA OFFICIALS, OR ON THE NATURE OF THE PLANE\\'S\\nMISSION.  THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE RESPONSE THAT THE U.S.\\nGOVERNMENT MADE A FEW DAYS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH A PLANE CRASH IN EL\\nSALVADOR.\\n\\n   AFTER A PLANE CARRYING WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS CRASHED\\nON 25 NOVEMBER, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED THE\\nUNDERSECRETARY OF STATE ON THAT SAME EVENING TO SUMMON THE SOVIET\\nAMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES TO PROTEST TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR\\nUNDERMINING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND \"FAILING TO EXERCISE ITS\\nINFLUENCE\" TO STOP CUBA AND NICARAGUA FROM DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE\\nGUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR.  IN THIS CONNECTION, A U.S.  GOVERNMENT\\nOFFICIAL POINTED OUT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD PRESENT THE CENTRAL\\nAMERICA ISSUE AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHILE DISCUSSING PROBLEMS OF\\nREGIONAL CONFLICTS WITH SOVIET LEADERS DURING THEIR MEDITERRANEAN\\nMEETING.  SOME OFFICIALS EVEN SAID THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE IS\\nTHE \"PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE\" TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS,\\nAND THAT ONLY WHEN THE USSR MAKES FURTHER CONCESSIONS ON THE CENTRAL\\nAMERICA ISSUE WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE\\nECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE SOVIET UNION.\\n\\n   IN A CEASEFIRE ACCORD SIGNED ON 24 JUNE THIS YEAR, UNITA AND THE\\nANGOLAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO SEEK WAYS AND MEANS TO CONCLUDE THE CIVIL\\nWAR THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 14 YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT\\nKEEPS SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA.  ACCORDING TO U.S.  NEWSPAPERS, EVER\\nSINCE THE SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES STOPPED SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA\\nLAST APRIL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME UNITA\\'S MAIN WEAPON SUPPLIER.\\nTHE SECRET THAT THE UNITED STATES\\' MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UNITA\\nINCREASED FROM $15 MILLION TO $50 MILLION THIS YEAR WAS REVEALED AFTER\\nTHE CRASH OF THE CIA\\'S WEAPON CARRIER.  NOW, EVEN THE U.S. PRESS HAS\\nASKED THIS QUESTION: COULD IT PREVENT PRESIDENT BUSH FROM PRESENTING\\nHIS CRITICISM WHEN PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE DISCUSSED WHEN\\nHE MEETS THE SOVIET LEADER?  A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID:\\n\"NOT AT ALL,\" \"WE WILL NOT PLACE (THE TWO) ON A PAR.\"  A STATE\\nDEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE\\nTO PROVIDE \"APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\" TO UNITA IN THE\\nFUTURE.\\n\\n\\nTST1-MUC3-0030\\n\\n   NO CITY (PERU), 16 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] AS A LATIN\\nAMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THE\\nSTATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED\\nIN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FOR\\nPRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET\\'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM.\\nTHAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTER\\nFROM ONLY ONE SIDE.  OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVER\\nIS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLE\\nFOR THEM.  THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY.  AS\\nPRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGE\\nREGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHO\\nMUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES.\\n\\n   WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHED\\nTHESE CONCLUSIONS.  WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEEN\\nHANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOS\\nGALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN\\nOFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERE\\nRESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEN\\nEXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE.  THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THE\\nWORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF\\nAIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF\\nDOLLARS TO COLOMBIA.  AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLY\\nHELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIAN\\nGOVERNMENT, WERE SENT.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSE\\nHELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU.\\n\\n   I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORT\\nPRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY.  IF HE HAS THAT MUCH\\nCONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF\\nWHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO\\nREPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATIN\\nAMERICA.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITH\\nPRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS.  THEN, AS\\nPRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME.  BUT THE\\nMEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTAL\\nINTEREST IN THE FUTURE.\\n\\n   [CORRESPONDENT] WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEAR\\nFUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND A\\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM.\\nCARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECT\\nDEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT.  THOSE MONOPOLIES\\nMIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS\\nGROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE IT\\nWAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIAL\\nMILITARY REGIME.  IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITY\\nOF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES,\\nWHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY A\\nMATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OF\\nOUR SOCIAL LIFE.  I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREE\\nPRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S.  PRESIDENT KNOW OUR\\nVIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM.\\n\\n   [CORRESPONDENT] WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] I DON\\'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE.  THE IDEA EMERGED\\nIN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITH\\nPRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.\\n\\n   [CORRESPONDENT] A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THIS\\nMONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS.\\nFOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP\\nABROAD.  I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH\\nPRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY\\n1990.\\n\\n   [CORRESPONDENT] CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEEN\\nSAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERU\\nFROM THE IMF.  WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSION\\nMEAN?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BE\\nEXPELLED FROM THE IMF.  SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM\\nREGARDING THE MATTER.  WHAT IS THE IMF?  IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR\\nBANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH\\nBALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR\\nFOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS.  WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100\\nMILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR\\nIMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS.  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO\\nFACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  AN IMF\\nCREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT\\nPROGRAM.  ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY\\'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTION\\nSO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY\\'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBT\\nOBLIGATIONS.

WE ARE GOING TO GIVE\\nYOU MILITARY INFORMATION FROM THE METROPOLITAN WAR FRONT, AS FOLLOWS:\\n\\n   THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION ARMORED VEHICLES\\nIN CUSCATANCINGO.  AT 0700, THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMBUSH IN WHICH SIX\\nARMORED VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED.  THE AMBUSH WAS STAGED AGAINST\\nATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS IN CUSCATANCINGO WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO\\nREINFORCE ENEMY POSITIONS UNDER ATTACK IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE\\nCAPITAL.  OUR FORCES USED ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND SMALL ARMS FIRE, AS\\nWELL AS EXPLOSIVES, TO AMBUSH THIS CONVOY, DESTROYING SIX ARMORED\\nVEHICLES.\\n\\n   IN ADDITION, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION [FMLN] FIGHTERS\\nATTACKED BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  THE BELLOSO\\nBATTALION CALLED FOR AIR SUPPORT, WHICH IT RECEIVED, BUT THIS HAS\\nRESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BECAUSE THE HELICOPTERS USED HAVE\\nBEEN BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AYUTUXTEPEQUE\\nAREA.  THE DESPERATE AIR SUPPORT HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN\\nVICTIMS.\\n\\n   MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES BEGAN ATTACKING ENEMY POSITIONS IN LOS\\nSANTOS, BOSQUES DEL RIO, AND UNICENTRO, IN SOYAPANGO.\\n\\n   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT BARRICADES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BUILT IN\\nTHE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR\\'S NORTHERN AND\\nSOUTHERN SECTORS.  THESE ARE BARRICADES BUILT BY YOUTHS, STUDENTS,\\nWORKERS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO HELP\\nWITH FOOD AND INFORMATION AND WHO, WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, ARE BUILDING\\nBARRICADES AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF THE VANGUARD:  THE FMLN.\\n\\n   WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT THE FIGHTING WHICH\\nHAD DECREASED IN THE UNIVERSITY AREA RESUMED AT 0600 THIS MORNING.\\n\\n\\nTST1-MUC3-0042\\n\\n   TEGUCIGALPA, 20 DEC 89 (VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]\\n[TEXT] FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA ISLAND, THE WORLD\\nDISCARDED ANY FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF A U.S.  ARMED OPERATION AGAINST\\nANOTHER NATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, DESPITE THE DETERIORATION OF\\nITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE U.S.\\nGOVERNMENT.  IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE U.S.  WOULD CONFINE ITS\\nPARTICIPATION TO SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING MOVEMENTS AIMED AT OUSTING\\nGOVERNMENTS OR, AS IN THE CASE OF NICARAGUA, OF SUPPORTING REBEL\\nFORCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET BY THE WHITE HOUSE.\\n\\n   THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN PANAMA HAVE\\nSURPRISED THE WORLD BECAUSE, DESPITE GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA\\'S\\nCHALLENGING ATTITUDE, NO ONE THOUGHT THE U.S. WOULD INVADE PANAMA.\\nNORIEGA WAS CERTAIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT DO SO, AND SUPPOSED\\nTHAT U.S. ATTITUDES AGAINST HIM WOULD CONSIST OF SPONSORING REBELLION,\\nSUCH AS THE RECENT 3-OCTOBER ATTEMPT, WHEN THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT\\nENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES TO REBEL AGAINST\\nTHEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  NORIEGA NEVER THOUGHT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\\nWOULD EVER CONDUCT A MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST PANAMA, ALTHOUGH THERE\\nWERE U.S. TROOPS BASED ON THE CANAL ZONE.  HE CONTINUED UNDER THIS\\nIMPRESSION BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THESE TROOPS CHANGED FROM THEIR\\nROLE OF SURVEILLANCE, NOT EVEN WHEN WASHINGTON PROMOTED THE REBELLION\\nOF SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE PANAMANIAN FORCES.\\n\\n   THIS EXCESSIVE SECURITY DISTRACTED NORIEGA AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO\\nCHALLENGE THE U.S. POLICIES.  NORIEGA DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S.\\nTHREATS AND HE ADOPTED AN OMNIPOTENT STANCE, LIKE HIS RECENT DECISION\\nTO APPOINT HIMSELF THE SUPREME LEADER OF PANAMA.  NORIEGA BELIEVED\\nTHAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION IN HIS\\nCOUNTRY, AND THAT THE U.S. DECISION TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION\\nCURRENTLY IN EXILE WOULD PRODUCE MOVEMENTS AGAINST HIS REGIME, OR THAT\\nA COMMANDO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP HIM.  AS A RESULT OF THIS BELIEF,\\nHE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND EQUIPPED MANY\\nCIVILIANS WHO SUPPORTED HIM WITH WEAPONS TO BE READY TO DISMANTLE\\nMOVEMENTS THAT TRIED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT.\\n\\n   AS THE CLOCKS STRUCK MIDNIGHT IN PANAMA, THE U.S. FORCES BEGAN AN\\nOPERATION AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCE BARRACKS.  THE TROOPS\\nALREADY BASED IN PANAMA, AND THOSE FLOWN IN FROM BASES IN CALIFORNIA\\nAND IN OTHER CITIES NEAR PANAMA, STARTED A MASSIVE ATTACK TO OUST GEN\\nNORIEGA.\\n\\n   THE INVASION, WHICH SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SOME AND TO OTHERS [WORDS\\nINDISTINCT], WERE MAINLY CONDUCTED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN\\nDECLARED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY\\nTHE U.S. COURTS.\\n\\n   EARLY THIS MORNING, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT\\nTHE OPERATION WAS AIMED AT CAPTURING NORIEGA AND TAKING HIM TO THE\\nUNITED STATES TO BE TRIED FOR THE CRIMES ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE U.S.\\nCOURTS, AT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TREATIES ON THE PANAMA CANAL,\\nAND AT RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FARCICAL\\nMAY-L989 ELECTIONS.\\n\\n   THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN PANAMA,\\nWHICH IS FILLING THE WORLD WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE DANGER HOVERING\\nOVER THE CONTINENT AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH\\'S DECISION HAS\\nGONE BEYOND THE LOGIC OF THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA.\\n\\n   INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DID, HOWEVER, GUESS THAT SOMETHING WAS\\nABOUT TO OCCUR WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID RECENTLY THAT WHILE THE U.S.\\nGOVERNMENT COULD REACH AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA, WITH NORIEGA IT WAS\\nIMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD TO\\nDO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VEILED DANGER THAT THREATENED THE AMERICAN\\nCONTINENT.\\n\\n   TODAY, PANAMA HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD.  THE CAPITAL AND OTHER\\nCITIES ARE BATTLEFIELDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FIGHTING\\nTHE U.S. UNITS IN GROUND, AIR, AND MARITIME OPERATIONS THAT SEEK TO\\nOUST MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA.\\n\\n   THE U.S. ACTION IS FOCUSSING THE WORLD\\'S ATTENTION ON WASHINGTON\\'S\\nDECISION.  MANY NATIONS WILL PROTEST AND REJECT THE U.S. INVASION\\nWHICH WAS DISGUISED BY A SERIES OF PEACE-SEEKING ACTIONS.\\n\\n   FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE, THE GHOST OF WAR IS HAUNTING OUR\\nCONTINENT.  WE MUST PONDER ON THE NEED TO KEEP HONDURAS ON THE\\nDEMOCRATIC PATH, AND TO AVOID THE ANARCHY THAT DESTROYS NATIONS AND\\nDECIMATES PEOPLES.  THE EVENTS THAT HAVE KEPT THE WORLD IN VIGIL SINCE\\nMIDNIGHT WILL CONTINUE FOR HOURS, DAYS, OR MAYBE WEEKS BECAUSE, SO\\nFAR, THE NEWS IS VERY CONFUSING AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS ARE DYING ON THE\\nSTREETS OF THE PANAMANIAN TOWNS.  \\n\\n\\nTST1-MUC3-0043\\n\\n   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN\\nCOMMANDER SANCHO BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]\\n[REPORTER] COMMANDER, DO THE RN LEADERS AGREE THAT THE FMLN SHOULD\\nEVENTUALLY JOIN THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL [SI] AS HAS BEEN PROPOSED\\nCONCERNING THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] IN\\nNICARAGUA?\\n\\n   [SANCHO] WE THINK SO, BECAUSE SI HAS REPRESENTED, FOR THE PAST\\n30-40 YEARS, A EUROPEAN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL BLOC THAT HAS\\nSUPPORTED THE STRUGGLE....[CORRECTS HIMSELF] THAT HAS SHOWN INTEREST\\nIN THE THIRD WORLD.

SOMEONE EVEN SAID THAT THE BRIGHT IDEA OF\\nDISCHARGING ME WAS CONSIDERED.  THEY FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT,\\nHOWEVER, THAT I AM A DEPUTY AND THAT, AS A DEPUTY AND A CITIZEN, I AM\\nENTITLED TO EXPRESS WHAT I FEEL, JUST AS I HAVE DONE.  I, WHO OWE\\nEVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS AS\\nMONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN IN\\nTHE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF\\nTHEM, OF COURSE.  THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM.\\n\\n   I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUT\\nTHE ARMED FORCES\\' SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES.  I SIMPLY\\nDEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOT\\nCONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A\\nSINGLE PERSON.  I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE\\nINSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH.  I ONLY HAVE RESPECT AND\\nLOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATION\\nTO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOME\\nNEFARIOUS MEMBERS.  I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD,\\nWHO FIGHT EVERY DAY.  OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVE\\nPROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, AS\\nIF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THE\\nINSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE.  QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  MY\\nCRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATION\\nAND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION.  I WOULD LIKE THEM TO\\nSTOP MAKING RIDICULOUS DEMANDS AND TO STOP SEEKING A CONFRONTATION.\\nIT IS KNOWN THAT WHAT I AM DEMANDING IS WHAT IS BEING FELT AND SAID.\\nI AM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE IN PARTICULAR.  I AM ONLY DEMANDING JUSTICE.\\nCOMMANDERS\\' MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT.\\nTHEY SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD SHOWN THEIR CONCERN OVER THE ARMED FORCES\\'\\nSITUATION.  I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM TAKE THE\\nSTAND TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO THE LAST CONSEQUENCES.  AS THE\\nMILITARY MAN I AM, I ONLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED\\nANY NAMES, BUT INSISTED THAT A DEEPER INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO CARRY\\nOUT JUSTICE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS THE INSTITUTION THAT WILL SUFFER.\\n\\n   [REPORTER] COL OCHOA, AFTER THE \"SIXTY MINUTES\" PROGRAM ON CBS IN\\nTHE UNITED STATES, IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRY\\nYOUR REMARKS AND YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JESUITS\\' CASE WERE\\nDISTORTED.  TODAY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCUSE YOU. IT HAS BEEN\\nSAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THE\\nRESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THE\\nINVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS\\' CASE.  DO YOU THINK THERE HAS\\nBEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE\\nADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION?\\n\\n   [OCHOA] I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF I\\nCOULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  A REDUCTION\\nIN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS\\nBECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED.  I THINK IT IS\\nRIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT\\nOF MY REMARKS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED\\nFORCES\\' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED.\\nMY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF\\nOPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES\\' CONSTITUTIONAL\\nMISSION.  HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE\\nPROTECTED.\\n\\n   I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF\\nTO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT HAS\\nENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SAN\\nSEBASTIAN PEOPLE.  I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES.\\nONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY.  THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERY\\nWAR.  I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE\\nCOMMANDER IN CABANAS.  I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THE\\nPOPULATION TO HELP THEM.  I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THE\\nARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MY\\nMEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF\\nTHE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES.  TO POINT THESE THINGS OUT\\nIS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSE\\nI LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS.

WE MUST\\nPARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.\\n\\n   HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE US\\nFORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR\\nFATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTS\\nECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEED\\nFOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES.\\n\\n   WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL\\nPOLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THE\\nMOUNTAIN RANGE.  THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS.\\nHOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGH\\nTHE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES.\\n\\n   IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGAL\\nPUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED.\\nSTIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES.\\n\\n   THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE,\\nDRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY I\\nPROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRY\\nTERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECT\\nBECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. I\\nWOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND\\nINSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN\\nCONGRESS.\\n\\n   BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UP\\nANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.\\nTHIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\\n\\n   FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU\\'S\\nDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THE\\nBATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARY\\nCOURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD\\nIMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THE\\nFACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKED\\nFOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES.\\nSO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, AS\\nPRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUT\\nDELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS.\\n\\n   FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF\\nPERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT\\nOF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS AND\\nTHEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE.\\n\\n   THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAY\\nTHAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALF\\nTRUE.  ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY,\\nPOLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY\\nJURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT\\nAPPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235,\\nWHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OF\\nBETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR.\\n\\n   NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOT\\nWANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHO\\nAVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OF\\nJUSTICE.  THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY\\nALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSE\\nTERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEY\\nCOMMIT CRIMES.\\n\\n   MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARY\\nSERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO,\\nAFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2\\nYEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THE\\nCOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.\\n\\n   THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THE\\nCOMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANS\\nWHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIR\\nMILITARY OBLIGATIONS.

THE DOCUMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF HOW\\nMUCH WE HAVE ADVANCED IN SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF\\nENERGY, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND BORDER TRANSIT; IN JOINT\\nPROGRAMS IN CITY PLANNING SUCH AS THE CUCUTA-VILLA EL ROSARIO-SAN\\nANTONIO-URENA; IN THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS, AND\\nIN INDIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, CUSTOMS, AND EDUCATION.  ALL OF THESE ARE\\nTOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE\\nTEAMS.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE.\\n\\n   THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST AND\\nDEMOCRATIC PROJECT.  THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVE\\nNATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARD\\nWORKING PEOPLE.  THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HE\\nEXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION,\\nAND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES AND\\nCONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS.  OUR COMMISSIONS HAVE\\nSUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATER\\nBASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADY\\nBEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS.\\n\\n   COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, AND\\nUNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR.\\nTHE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY AND\\nTELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUS\\nALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGES\\nTHAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZA\\nAIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THE\\nAGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGING\\nFROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERS\\nTO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS.\\n\\n   THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONAL\\nCONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL,\\nIT POINTS TO PEOPLE\\'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR\\nCONSUMPTION.  IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THE\\nPEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHING\\nOR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE\\'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED.\\n\\n   I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAY\\nIS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICAN\\nINTEGRATION.  BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIR\\nRULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAY\\nCONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENT\\nIN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR,\\nBOLIVAR.\\n\\n   MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TO\\nWORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO.  THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH A TRULY\\nLIBERATING TASK, THAT TODAY -- AS FROM THE TIMES OF THE CONGRESS OF\\nANGOSTURA -- IS UNITING OUR TWO NATIONS.  THANK YOU.

ALSO, WE WANT TO STATE OUR DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE FRIENDLY\\nCOUNTRIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY-- MOST OF ALL\\nTHEIR SOLIDARITY WITH YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE-- BECAUSE THERE HAVE\\nBEEN STATEMENTS WHICH, FRANKLY, HAVE FILLED US WITH EMOTION. FOR\\nEXAMPLE, THOSE OF COSTA RICA, THE UNITED STAES, GUATEMALA, AND, IN\\nSHORT, ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW IRRATIONAL\\nTHE FMLN\\'S AGGRESSION IS.

DUARTE\\nPROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL\\nREFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE.\\n\\n   ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON\\'S\\nGREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHER\\nWORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY.  FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN.  IN\\nREALITY 8 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE EL SALVADOR BECAME THE PLACE WHERE\\nTHE REAGAN ERA\\'S MODELS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY, NEODICTATORSHIP, AND\\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE WERE IMPLEMENTED.\\n\\n   WASHINGTON\\'S EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED.  THE\\n19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nSALVADORAN STRATEGY.  TWO BASIC FACTORS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE U.S.\\nFAILURE: FIRST, THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT DEMAGOGIC AND POLITICALLY\\nUNSOUND REFORMS.  DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES\\'\\nEXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION.  SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR,\\nAND DEMOCRATIC FORCES\\' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WAS\\nPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORE\\nTHAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED.\\n\\n   THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA IS\\nTHE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC\\nSECTORS.  WASHINGTON HAS RETURNED TO ITS STARTING POINT.  THE $3\\nBILLION SPENT ON MILITARY ADVICE AND THE GENOCIDE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS\\nOF SALVADORANS SERVED NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER.  IT IS ALL OVER.  ARENA\\nREPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979.  IN\\nOTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL,\\nECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER.  THIS IS THE END, THE SAD END OF THE\\nLOW-INTENSITY WAR EXERCISE.\\n\\n   U.S. GENERAL HARRY GORDON SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE SANTA FE GROUP,\\nIN HIS BOOK ON THE MISTAKES THE UNITED STATES MADE IN VIETNAM, SAID\\nTHE UNITED STATES\\' CONCEPT OF VICTORY AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN VIETNAM CAN\\nNO LONGER BE TO ACHIEVE ITS ENEMY\\'S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, AS IN\\nWORLD WAR II, BUT TO ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH IT\\nSTARTED THE WAR.  THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED IN\\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.  ARENA\\'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO\\nTHE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OF\\nLOW-INTENSITY WARFARE.\\n\\n   FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WAS\\nSQUANDERED.  FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, IT MEANS\\nRAZED TOWNS, DEVASTATED ECONOMIES, AND THE DEATH OF 70,000 PEOPLE.\\nTHE NEW U.S.  ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR EL\\nSALVADOR.

I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO\\nMEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

THEY ARE THE ONES WHO\\n-- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY\\nJEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM\\nTHEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.

[CONTINUED]\\n\\n\\nTST2-MUC4-0006\\n\\n   SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT\\nALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO\\nTHANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY\\nIMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVE\\nHEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A\\nWORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO\\nHAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR\\nOWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF\\nLOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE\\nGREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,\\nUNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,\\nAND WELL-BEING.\\n\\n   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE\\nCONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD\\nMEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A\\nFEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL\\nPRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,\\nAND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.\\nPERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE\\nNOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE\\nISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO\\nMONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.\\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE\\nTHAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE\\nPRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,\\nESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.\\n\\n   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN\\nGENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,\\nTHOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE\\nSUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A\\nGOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS\\nAVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO\\nIMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET\\nUS THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN\\nFAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO\\nBENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO\\nBUY A VEHICLE.\\n\\n   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS\\nEXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,\\nWHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS\\nCAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE\\nLITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE\\nHAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.\\nMOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT\\nPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES\\nTO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE\\nCURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.\\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --\\nTHROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN\\nNOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO\\nPRICE INCREASE.\\n\\n   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE\\nGAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES\\nARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE\\nSOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR\\nNOTHING AT ALL.\\n\\n   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF\\nSOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS\\nTHE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE\\nLOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT\\nCHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE\\nMUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT\\nFIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN\\nEFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.\\n\\n   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH\\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE\\nCHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS\\nTO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO\\nSENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING\\nHAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE\\nSHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.\\n\\n   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET\\nDISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO\\nLONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO\\nSUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO\\nSEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND\\nACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.\\n\\n   THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR\\nCOUNTRY\\'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE\\nPHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL\\nSALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT\\nTHOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.\\n\\n   THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF\\nTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR\\nSOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS\\nKNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN\\nCOME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND\\nMAY GOD BLESS YOU.  \\n\\n\\nTST2-MUC4-0007\\n\\n   MEDELLIN, 12 APR 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN\\nGOMEZ MARTINEZ ONCE MORE INSISTED TODAY ON \"AN IMMEDIATE DIALOGUE\"\\nBETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COCAINE TRAFFICKERS \"TO END THE WAR IN\\nWHICH INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED.\"\\n\\n   THE MAYOR REITERATED HIS POSITION WHEN HE COMMENTED ON THE ATTACK\\nIN WHICH 20 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND APPROXIMATELY 100 WERE INJURED,\\nWHICH WAS PERPETRATED YESTERDAY BY TERRORISTS ON THE DRUG CARTEL\\'S\\nPAYROLL NEAR ITAGUI MUNICIPALITY.\\n\\n   THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD\\nEARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS\\nWELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES.\\n\\n   A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB (CONTAINING 300 KG OF\\nDYNAMITE) WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL\\nPASSED BY.\\n\\n   ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, \"THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN\\n(PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS\\') GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH\\nPREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS,\" PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES.\\n\\n   \"THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO\\nSTART NOW,\" INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD\\'S\\nMOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\n   THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE\\nASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE\\nGOVERNMENT\\'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

WE HAVE NOT RETREATED A\\nSINGLE STEP. IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE\\nENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY\\nDICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND.

ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY\\nGERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE\\nOF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR\\nTWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO\\nEXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE\\nBRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,\\nWHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.\\nPALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING\\nTHE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.\\n\\n   THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO\\nGROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE\\nSECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE\\nWHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO\\nVIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS\\nTHAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO\\nBENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION.\\nTHE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE\\nPALERMO\\'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS\\' MAIN COCAINE\\nSUPPLIER.\\n\\n   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO\\nDO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE\\nCORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO\\nSUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM\\nSMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE\\nSTOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS\\nMORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS\\nINVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY\\nOF DRUGS EVERY DAY.\\n\\n   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF\\nTHEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY\\nFOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO\\nSUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS\\nCARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE\\nFOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN\\nTRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,\\nARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS\\nOF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES\\nTHE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN\\nBOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO\\nSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE\\nWHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO\\nFOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE\\nTRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),\\nNEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES\\nOF COCAINE.\\n\\n   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE\\nDRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND\\nACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE\\nLARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF\\nDRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN\\nBY LAW.\\n\\n   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ\\nREGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,\\nAND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE\\nTRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,\\nAND EVEN IN CHILDREN\\'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY\\nBUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF\\nTRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE\\nCOMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED\\nIN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.  \\n\\n\\nTST2-MUC4-0010\\n\\n   NO CITY, NO DATE -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PERUVIAN PRESIDENT GARCIA\\nBY AMAT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [AMAT] MR.\\nPRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS\\nEXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN\\nGENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS\\nLLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO\\nEVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER\\nETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS\\nCONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\\n\\n   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE\\nPRESIDENCY?\\n\\n   [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.\\n\\n   [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...\\n\\n   [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE\\nSOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.

A SIGN OF THIS WAS\\nTHE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD\\nINDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE\\nGROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A\\nMILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS.\\nTHOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING\\nOF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY\\nWOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY\\nPATH.

ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED\\nTHAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW\\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF\\nEVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL\\nSALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.\\nIN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.\\nON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD\\nTURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT\\nVIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS\\nMEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A\\nCOMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED\\nOF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.\\nTHIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE\\nMILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT\\nTO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT\\nTHE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A\\nCOUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING\\nTO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL\\nDESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.

A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILL\\nDO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME.

[PASSAGE OMITTED]\\n\\n   [GARCIA] LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THE\\nESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION\\nHAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NO\\nRELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF\\nUNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS.\\nCOLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTH\\nKOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITION\\nTELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM.\\nNOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARI\\nABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODY\\nHAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSE\\nCOUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZE\\nNORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION.\\n\\n   SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HAS\\nSAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE.\\nTHIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTH\\nKOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVE\\nMADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF\\nCIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO\\nELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.\\n\\n   THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFF\\nTO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.  IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH\\nAUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND.  ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE\\nPEOPLES OF THE WORLD.  UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE\\nFRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR.  THIS MANICHEAN\\nCRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER\\nVALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED.  HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS\\nCOUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN\\'T?  PERU WILL NOT\\nACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS.  WE HAVE HAD\\nENOUGH OF THE 1960\\'S AND 1970\\'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOT\\nTRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA.  PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO\\nTRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH.  THIS\\nIS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF\\nOFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE.\\n\\n   FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT\\nOF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OF\\nTHE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.  THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLE\\nSPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HAD\\nBEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE.  JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOW\\nMANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTS\\nIN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS.  NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY ARE\\nOPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.

THE PROPOSAL COVERS THE SUPPLY OF OIL AND THE SALE OF\\nFINISHED PRODUCTS.  ANOTHER POINT INCLUDED IS THE REFINANCING OF THE\\nGUATEMALAN DEBT WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH TOTALS $200 MILLION.\\n\\n   THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT\\'S ACTIVITIES BEGAN TODAY AT MIRAFLORES\\nPALACE WHEN, PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE TWO AGREEMENTS, THE\\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH HIS GUATEMALAN\\nCOUNTERPART.  THE PRESIDENTS THEN HELD A FORMAL WORK SESSION WITH THE\\nPARTICIPATION OF TWO COMMISSIONS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL.  GUATEMALA,\\nLIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, ARE\\nFACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTS\\nAS THEY MATURE.  THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONE\\nOF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE\\nTODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TO\\nRESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENT\\nINTEREST.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THE\\nVENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSE\\nAGREEMENT.  FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FIT\\nVENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW AND\\nTHE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE\\nTERMS.  WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THE\\nMEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE AND\\nUNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. [END RECORDING]\\n\\n   WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN\\nVENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY.  ONE OF THEM IS A\\nCOOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT.  ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC AND\\nTECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS,\\nWHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS.  AS ENERGY AND MINES\\nMINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILL\\nPERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARMAS] FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OIL\\nEXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THAT\\nCOULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA.  WITH\\nREGARD TO MINING, WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING\\nSOME PROGRESS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN GUATEMALA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF\\nHELPING GUATEMALA DISCOVER MINERAL DEPOSITS THAT COULD BE VERY\\nATTRACTIVE FOR OUR ECONOMIES. [END RECORDING]\\n\\n   FOLLOWING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE,\\nGUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WENT TO THE CELA [ECONOMIC\\nCOMISSION FOR LATIN AMERICA].

HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR \"FREEDOM,\" \"DEMOCRACY,\"\\nAND \"HUMAN RIGHTS\" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OF\\nTHE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT.\\n\\n   ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S.  TROOPS,\\nEQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTO\\nPANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIO\\nNORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO\\nMEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND\\nKIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME.  THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT\\nESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT\\nLEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF\\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.  MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND\\nADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY\\nU.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION.  THE\\nUNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW\\nPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER\\nSTATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED [AS\\nPUBLISHED] THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC\\nAPARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\\nUNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS\\nHAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO\\nPULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS.\\n\\n   JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\\nIMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF\\nWARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT\\nWAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR\\nTRAFFICKING IN DRUGS.  ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES,\\nIGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A\\nFLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"KENNEDY\" AND\\nNUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER \"VIRGINIA,\" TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO\\n\"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING.\"  SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE\\nSOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE\\nDEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED\\nFIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS.\\nJARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC\\nUNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES \"VERY NEARLY\" INVADED COLOMBIA.\\nTHE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE\\nAUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS\\nARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR [AS PUBLISHED] THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA.  IT\\nALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS\\nTO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY\\'S SOVEREIGNTY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE\\nGOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO\\nJOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. \"DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL\" IN THE CARIBBEAN.  FACED\\nWITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE\\n\"DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET\" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE \"DRILL.\"\\n\\n   ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOME\\nLATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THE\\nSOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE \"RIGHT\" TO INTERFERE\\nBY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES.  THE\\nPUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S.\\nAGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF\\nINTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF\\nWHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980\\'S.\\n\\n   IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE\\n1980\\'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE,\\nNAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED\\nIN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES.  THE\\nREAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN\\nCENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY.\\n\\n   IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN\\nCENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON\\nVICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING,\\nAND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL\\nAMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTER\\nADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH A\\nCERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS.  IN 1977 THE\\nCARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THE\\nPANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVER\\nTHE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE.  BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUA\\nREVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORT\\nFOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITH\\nTHE SANDINISTA REGIME.

THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEEN\\nA SENSATION TO CHILE.  WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTIC\\nRADICAL CHANGES?\\n\\n   AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREAT\\nIMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND.  THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE.  THE\\nOPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN\\nRELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANS\\nTO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN.

FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT.  CHILE IS\\nTRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.  NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF A\\nDICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER.  THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOM\\nCOINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE.  THAT IS A\\nSTIMULATING FEELING.  WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY.\\nSECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OUR\\nCOUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATIC\\nFUTURE.  I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION\\nDEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD.  NOR\\nFOR CHILE.\\n\\n   DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATIN\\nAMERICA.  HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED?  WHAT WAS ITS REACTION?\\n\\n   AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHIC\\nAND COHERENT PARTY.  IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG\\nTIME.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE\\nTHE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED\\nBY COMMUNIST PARTIES.  THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE\\nADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.\\n\\n   DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM,\\nTHE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY?  DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM?\\nDO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES?\\n\\n   AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH\\nSENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973.  WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE\\nOFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A\\nPOLITICAL FUNCTION.  MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN\\nMISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM\\'S\\nSECRET ALLY.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS\\nCAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT.  THAT HAS BEEN DONE\\nIN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS.\\n\\n   DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY.  WILL IT BE\\nREPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT?\\n\\n   AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL.\\n\\n   DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTER\\nGOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITION\\nTODAY.\\n\\n   AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT.  THE VARIOUS\\nSOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED.  HOWEVER, THE STRONGEST\\nMOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER.\\n\\n   DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMA\\nOF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE?\\n\\n   AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.  THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES\\nIN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL\\nDEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST\\nFAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER.  THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE.\\n\\n   DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE\\nSTRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAY\\nIN THE FUTURE?\\n\\n   AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR.

HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE,\\nTHE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF\\nVIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF \"INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS.\"  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS\\nNO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL\\nSOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.\\n\\n   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE\\nDIALOGUE, ADDING:  \"IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE\\nHELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT\\nDOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE\\nFOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS,\\nTHE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE\\nPLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE\\nWILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT\\nHAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE\\nKNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO\\nSO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT,\\nONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVE\\nTHAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR\\nYEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN\\nOVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT\\'S\\nPOSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST\\nLOGICAL ONE.\"\\n\\n   TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO\\nSOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HE\\nSAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO\\nREFORM THE GOVERNMENT\\'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME\\nGROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A\\nPROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN\\nELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE\\nMAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE\\nCONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES\\nLIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND\\nLARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.\\n\\n   REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED\\nWITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE.\\nTO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE\\nPOPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO\\nOFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE\\nTO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE\\nTO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND\\nFASTER SERVICE.\"\\n\\n   ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO\\nELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED,\\nTHAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO\\nLIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY\\nPROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT\\nWITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC\\nEXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"\\n\\n   TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKE\\nSHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE\\nMEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED\\nTHE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO\\nCONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC\\nBREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START\\nELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY\\nINCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE\\nREST OF THE COUNTRY\\'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"\\n\\n   CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME\\nTAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON\\nREVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM\\'S PRESENT\\nSITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED\\nON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM\\'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND\\nMORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM\\'S INCOME.\"\\n\\n   CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY\\'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT\\nINCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT\\nIT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE\\nCOUNTRY\\'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY.\\nREGARDING THE COUNTRY\\'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY\\nVALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN\\nEXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO\\nARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON.\\nEVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO\\nPAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO\\n1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN\\nEXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS\\' DEMANDS.\"\\n\\n   FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.\\n\\n\\nTST3-MUC4-0026\\n\\n   SANTIAGO, 16 JUL 89 -- [STATEMENT] [CHILEAN SOCIALIST PARTY, PS] [TEXT]\\n\\n   1. DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE\\nDIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME\\nMORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL\\nFORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS\\nMORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A\\nFREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR\\nORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE\\nWORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR\\nEXPERIENCES.\\n\\n   2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS\\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL\\nSITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES\\'\\nREVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE\\nGREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A\\nPROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT,\\nAND SOCIAL CHANGE.\\n\\n   3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL\\nSOCIALIST [SI] AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN\\nTHIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS.\\nFIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES\\nTHE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW\\nDAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE\\nCHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE\\'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL\\nASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE\\nWHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE\\nSI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN\\nCAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR\\nDEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND\\nCOOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS\\nAND PROPOSALS PRAISED.\\n\\n   4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND\\nTRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL\\nPROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE\\nTECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS,\\nEXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE\\nEMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE\\nWORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF\\nLIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE\\nVALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN\\nTHE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS\\nFRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS\\nIDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A\\nBROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN\\nAUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE\\nACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE\\nPLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE.\\n[CONTINUED]\\n\\n\\nTST3-MUC4-0027\\n\\n   GUATEMALA CITY, 1 AUG 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] DANILO BARILLAS, FORMER\\nGUATEMALAN AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN AND LEADER OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN\\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC], WAS KILLED TODAY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN\\nTHIS CAPITAL, THE POLICE REPORTED.\\n\\n   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, BARILLAS WAS HEADING DOWNTOWN FROM HIS\\nHOME IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY WHEN HE WAS INTERCEPTED BY A GROUP OF\\nUNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS, WHO SHOT HIM DOWN WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE.\\n\\n   THE POLICE SAID THAT SO FAR THE IDENTITIES OF THE ATTACKERS ARE UNKNOWN.\\nTHIS IS THE FIRST PDC LEADER KILLED SINCE PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO ASSUMED\\nPOWER IN JANUARY 1986.\\n\\n\\nTST3-MUC4-0028\\n\\n   TEGUCIGALPA, 5 AUG 89 (LA VOZ DE HONDURAS NETWORK) -- [NEWS\\nCONFERENCE WITH HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYOS BY UNIDENTIFIED\\nREPORTERS] [TEXT] [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE TOPICS TO BE\\nDISCUSSED DEALS WITH THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\\n[FMLN].\\n\\n   [AZCONA] I BELIEVE THAT AT THIS SUMMIT THE CENTRAL [WORDS INDISTINCT]. \\n\\n   [REPORTER] HOW, MR PRESIDENT?\\n\\n   [AZCONA] WELL, I DO NOT KNOW.

ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLE\\nSOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THE\\nASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA [WORDS\\nINDISTINCT], WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST].  THE COLOMBIAN DRUG\\nMAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITH\\nPOWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED\\nSTATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD.\\n\\n   YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST], VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ\\nSPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, AND\\nIT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THE\\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IT IS\\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES\\nPEREZ.  WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US,\\nALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA.  WE MUST ALSO\\nACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OUR\\nTIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARD\\nDRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS\\nANDRES PEREZ.\\n\\n   IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERAL\\nLATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THE\\nSITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATIN\\nAMERICAN COUNTRIES.  NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM...[REPHRASES] AS HAS\\nBEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT\\nFIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BE\\nBASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  THAT IS THE MAIN\\nSTUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THE UNITED STATES IS\\nTHE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUG\\nTRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELY\\nREPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  U.S.  POLICY, AND ALL THIS IS VERY WELL\\nKNOWN IN LATIN AMERICA, IS BASED ON DESTROYING THE PLANTATIONS OF A NATIVE\\nPLANT IN THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS COCA.

ONE OF\\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE\\nCOMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND\\nSOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT\\nHAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  THESE DEMANDS\\nARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN\\nRIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND\\nEFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING\\nTORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE\\nAGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE\\nDEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND\\nSINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO\\nCONVERT THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER] INTO AN AGENCY OF THE\\nARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE\\nUNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL.  JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFT\\nAND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECT\\nPHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE\\'S DEMANDS\\nCONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN?\\n\\n   [INZUNZA] THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE\\nNEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OF\\nTHE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FOR\\nVICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY AND\\nCOMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OF\\nCONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING\\nTRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BY\\nTHE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL\\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI.\\nALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN,\\nAND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS\\nWAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENT\\nSTRIKE BY COAL MINERS.  THIS PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOOD\\nTHAT THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR\\nACTIVITIES AND A WAY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE\\nFUTURE STRUGGLE. [END RECORDING]\\n\\n   THE PRECEDING COMMENTS WERE MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER\\nJAIME INZUNZA, WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE ON OUR\\nPROGRAM \"ESCUCHA CHILE.\"  ANOTHER TOPIC DISCUSSED BY INZUNZA WAS THE\\nEL MERCURIO REPORT ON THE CNI\\'S TRANSFER TO THE ARMY.  THE DISSOLUTION\\nOF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE\\nMAJORITY OF CHILEANS.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA,\\nON THE DICTATOR\\'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP\\nIT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND?\\n\\n   [INZUNZA] I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS.  THE\\nINTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE\\nDICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT\\nVIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I\\nUNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACED\\nBY CNI] AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE\\nTHE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.  IF\\nTRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET\\'S\\nORDERS.  UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?  FOR WHOM HAS\\nIT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS?  HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDER\\nTHE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY. [END\\nRECORDING]\\n\\n   COMMUNIST LEADER JAIME INZUNZA ADDED THAT PINOCHET\\'S INTENT IN\\nTRANSFERRING THE CNI TO THE ARMY\\'S DIRECT COMMAND IS TO MAKE THE\\nINSTITUTION AN ACCOMPLICE IN CONCEALING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\\nRESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.\\n\\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [INZUNZA] THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARY\\nINSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOT\\nRESPONSIBLE.  THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES\\nWANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS\\nVIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE TRANSFER OF\\nTHE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS\\nACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES.  LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE\\nHERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF\\nCRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE\\nMEN.  THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS\\nTRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MAN\\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATOR\\nHIMSELF.

WE HAVE BROKEN [WORDS INDISTINCT]\\nIN THE CAPITAL CITY, WE ARE FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE DENS OF COLONEL\\nPONCE AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAVE TURNED THE WAR INTO A BUSINESS.\\nTHOSE OFFICERS HAVE LUXURIOUS MANSIONS IN MIAMI.  EVERY WEEKEND AND\\nEVEN IN SPITE OF THE WAR, COL PONCE HAS ORGIES IN HIS LUXURIOUS HOMES\\nIN THE COUNTRY\\'S INTERIOR.  SOLDIERS, PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WE CALL ON\\nYOU TO JOIN THE PEOPLE AND JOIN OUR FRONT.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WHO\\nARE LISTENING TO US, DO NOT ALLOW MORE BOMBINGS IN OUR CAPITAL CITY BY\\nTHE GENOCIDAL TANDONA GROUP [1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN\\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL].  YOUNG OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS WHO ARE\\nBEING KILLED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL\\nCITY, WHY SHOULD YOU BE KILLED WHILE DEFENDING PONCE\\'S MANSIONS?  THIS\\nIS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO\\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE\\nPEOPLE.  WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER.\\n\\n   JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL.  OVER 500\\nHOMES WERE RAZED.  ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH\\nOFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS\\nWHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE?  YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL,\\nMEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO.  PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO\\nTALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING\\nTO DO WITH LA TANDONA.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT\\nIS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK\\nYOU.  THE FATHERLAND?  WHAT FATHERLAND?  THE FATHERLAND YOU ARE TOLD\\nYOU ARE DEFENDING ARE THE MILLIONS AND THE MANSIONS OF COL PONCE AND\\nOF COL ELENA FUENTES.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS: THE TIME IS HERE, TAKE ONE\\nSTEP FORWARD.\\n\\n   WE HAVE MORE REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR: EARLY THIS MORNING, COMBAT\\nHAS BEEN RESUMED IN THE FOLLOWING PLACES: ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND LA\\nSULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS\\nFROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY.  COMBATS ARE ALSO\\nREPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST\\nINFANTRY BRIGADE.  THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLIS\\nAND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTE\\nBATTALION.\\n\\n   IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANA\\nRESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE,\\nAND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT\\nNO. 6 OF SONSONATE.  TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN\\nSALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.\\nIN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE\\nCOUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS HAS YIELDED NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR\\nTHE HIGH COMMAND.  IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES\\nBETWEEN THE ATLACATL BATTALION AND THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND THE\\nNATIONAL GUARD HAS ATTACKED TROOPS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6.\\nTHESE ARE LITTLE SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO\\nTHE CAPITAL CITY, AND THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY.  THEY ARE\\nCLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER.\\n\\n   CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST\\nINFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY\\nBRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE\\nINTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY?  THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY.  THE SAN\\nFRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE.  THE 4TH\\nINFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY\\nDETACHMENT NO. 1.  THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS\\nINTO THE CAPITAL CITY.\\n\\n   THIS IS A GOOD REPORT.  THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY\\nDETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL.  THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THIS\\nMORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES.  WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT?  THE SONSONATE\\nSOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS GIVES US A GENERAL\\nPICTURE OF THE DEFEAT.  IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THE\\nLAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEEN\\nWIPED OUT.\\n\\n   ATTENTION, FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE OPENED FIRE WITH THEIR M-60\\nMACHINEGUNS AGAINST UH-1H HELICOPTERS THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE\\nRESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE OLIGARCHY.

IN FACT, AS THE NEWSPAPER SUGGESTS,\\nTHE YANKEE HAND IS TODAY IN EL SALVADOR AS IT WAS YESTERDAY IN\\nVIETNAM.  THE WOUNDED MOTHER WHO TRIES TO COMFORT HER DAUGHTER, A\\nVICTIM OF THE BOMBINGS, IS NOT AN ISOLATED PICTURE.  IT IS A SYMBOL OF\\nTHE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN\\nTHAT COUNTRY.\\n\\n   THE UNITED STATES IS NOT INNOCENT OF THESE CRIMES BECAUSE U.S.\\nPILOTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACRE.  IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT IS\\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION DOING?  IN FACT, HE IS DOING NOTHING THAT\\nCOULD NOT BE PREDICTED.  PRESIDENT BUSH GETS ON THE PHONE AND CALLS\\nHIS SALVADORAN CRONY ALFREDO CRISTINI TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYTHING IS\\nALL RIGHT, THAT HE CAN GO ON, THAT THE U.S.  POSITION IS FAVORABLE TO\\nHIS REGIME.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE\\nRECENT BRUTAL KILLINGS OF UNION LEADERS BY THE ARMY.  BUSH ASKS NO\\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF SPANISH PRIESTS.  THE PRESIDENT ONLY\\nPRAISES THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE, THE POLICE AND PARAMILITARY EFFORTS\\nTO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE.\\n\\n   BUSH AND CRISTIANI COULD NOT FAIL TO MENTION THE TRITE SLOGAN OF\\nTHE CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN AID TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS.  NOR DID\\nBUSH FAIL TO EXPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\\'S SOLIDARITY.  BUT,\\nSOLIDARITY WITH WHOM?  ALL WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT UP TO NOW ARE THE\\nPROTESTS PROVOKED IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE U.S.  MILITARY AID TO\\nTHE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE ONLY REALITIES ARE THE DEMONSTRATIONS\\nSTAGED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. AID.  THE\\nONLY FACT IS THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION IS BEING PUBLICLY\\nQUESTIONED ABOUT THIS AID.  THE ONLY PICTURE THAT HAS BEEN\\nDISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERRUPTS\\nBUSH\\'S SPEECH TO SHOUT TO HIM: WHY ARE WE SENDING MONEY TO EL\\nSALVADOR? WHY ARE WE KILLING PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR?  IT IS NOT\\nPOSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\\'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE\\nCURRENT SALVADORAN SITUATION.

THE FMLN LAUNCHED THIS AGGRESSION WITH ALL OF\\nITS FORCES, CHIEFLY USING A CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS AND FIGHTERS IN\\nTHE SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN ZONE, IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ\\nDEPARTMENT, AND AT TIMES IN USULUTAN CITY, USULUTAN DEPARMENT, AND IN\\nSAN MIGUEL CITY, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.  IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLN\\nDISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY.  IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS,\\nWHICH....[CHANGES THOUGHT] BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORAN\\nARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE IT\\nIS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADY\\nFOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS.\\n\\n   IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU,\\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE.  IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THE\\nIDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE\\nPEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM.  THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT\\nTHIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE.  FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THE\\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES IN\\nTHE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION.\\n\\n   HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.  IT IS\\nIMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORT\\nFROM SOMEONE ABROAD.  ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS\\nSUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENT\\nCASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREEN\\nIN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAY\\nDEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE\\nPUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA AND\\nCASTRO PARTICIPATE.  IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS\\nHAPPENED.  DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OF\\nANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS\\nWHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO\\nCOLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS IN\\nTHE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADE\\nLAUNCHERS.\\n\\n   WHAT HAPPENED?  IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KIND\\nOF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL\\nHOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES\\' JOINT\\nCHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISON\\nPARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  AS A RESULT OF THE\\nSAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED.  MOREOVER, LET US\\nRECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THAT\\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN AND\\nEL SALVADOR.  ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTS\\nMADE TO COSTA RICA.  IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FOR\\nCONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPEN\\nVIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS.\\n\\n   AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY?  ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE,\\nTWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED.  THEIR\\nFLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THE\\nONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND.  AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE A\\nDOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETA\\nTRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA\\'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINO\\nAIRPORT.  IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN.  IN\\nTHAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WAS\\nWEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARY\\nUNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANY\\nCOUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE.  IT IS\\nBELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.\\nWE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD A\\nWEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD.  HE KILLED HIMSELF\\nBECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF IMPLICATED IN THIS SITUATION.

WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY\\nCONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY\\nIN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM\\nMANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE\\nPRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS.\\n\\n   THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE\\nMEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN\\nGRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR\\nTHE FMLN.\\n\\n   WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN\\nAGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD.  HERE IN\\nEL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER\\nTERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY\\nWITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF\\nINTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS.\\n\\n   IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE\\nCAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS\\nDOCUMENT.

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO\\nHOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME\\nISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL?\\nON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT\\nOF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON?\\n\\n   [CRISTIANI] IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS\\nUNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A\\nFACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED\\nREVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC\\nPROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING\\nTHE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE\\nCOMMITMENTS.

LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED\\nNATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE,\\nESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, EL\\nSALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE\\n96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.\\n\\n   WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS\\nTHAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE\\nDICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THIS\\nWAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.\\n\\n   TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL\\nORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTH\\nAMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE\\nGENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN\\nSPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.\\n\\n   THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF\\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL\\nKNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE\\nCOUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.\\n\\n   THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF\\nINTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.\\n\\n   UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST\\nTHAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF\\nGUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT\\nOF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THIS\\nDOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\\nJOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN\\nAMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS,\\nWERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA\\n-- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING\\n-- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.  THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN\\nALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.\\n\\n   HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND\\nIN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS\\nACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT\\nWAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI\\nPREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE\\nHONDURAN PRESIDENT.\\n\\n   AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL\\nREGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE\\nBULL BY THE HORNS.\\n\\n   LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS.\\n[CONTINUED]\\n\\n\\nTST3-MUC4-0077\\n\\n   BOGOTA, 15 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] IN VIEW OF\\nTHE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TODAY IN WHICH GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON\\nFREDDY, AND SEVERAL OF HIS BODYGUARDS WERE KILLED, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO\\nTODAY CALLED AN URGENT COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION\\nAND RECEIVE A FULL REPORT FROM MILITARY AND POLICE AUTHORITIES.

THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE\\nTHE NEGOTIATION EFFORT.  ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE\\nHAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT.\\n\\n   2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC\\nLEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN\\nTHE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE\\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE\\nPERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE\\nDIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI\\'S GOVERNMENT\\nIS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY\\'S\\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES.

BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE\\nNUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S.  CITY HE\\nVISITED.  ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM\\nALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE]\\nREPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW\\nTO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY\\nTHE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND\\nCHECK THE ARMY\\'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG\\nHAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE\\nHE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE\\nWASHINGTON\\'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.\\n\\n   ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS\\nPREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE\\nRESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY\\nOFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY\\nEIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE\\nMUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT\\nSUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS.\\nMEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT\\nNEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO\\nSUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE\\nGUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY\\'S\\nINTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.\\n\\n   THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH\\nEVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE\\nGOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE\\nEYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO\\nDEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IF\\nSERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY\\nPOLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A\\nPRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY.\\n\\n   ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL\\nSALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN\\nQUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE\\nSALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR.  IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE\\nALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR\\nRESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE\\nSITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST\\nENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO\\nINFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING\\nTHE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS\\nPARTY.

WE MAINTAIN OUR\\nSTANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY AND\\nINDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\\nTHE FMLN CONDUCTS.

THEY\\nCOULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST,\\nBUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS\\nCONCERNED.  THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELY\\nPICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEM\\nBEST.  I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TO\\nTHE FSLN.  THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION IN\\nNICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA.  THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUS\\nEXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION.  THE FSLN\\nHAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION.\\n\\n   I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\\nTHE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO [NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION], THAT\\nIS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN.  YET, THE\\nPEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTS\\nTHAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DO\\nTHAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY.  LET ME REPEAT: THERE IS\\nNOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY.  THE\\nARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY\\'S DEMOCRATIC\\nPROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY.  WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVE\\nNOT BEEN SETTLED YET.

COL GOLCHER WAS SUPPOSEDLY IN ISRAEL\\nWHERE HE WAS SENT AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT\\'S MILITARY ATTACHE;\\nHOWEVER, THE WELL-KNOWN LEADER OF THE DEATH SQUADS WAS SEEN AT 0100 IN\\nDOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR ACCOMPANIED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE U.S. MILITARY\\nREPRESENTATIVE IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS HAPPENED ONLY HOURS AFTER COLONEL\\n[ADOLFO ARNOLDO] MAJANO\\'S BODYGUARDS WERE MURDERED.\\n\\n   THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS INCIDENT RAISE SEVERAL\\nQUESTIONS. WHAT WERE THESE TWO SOLDIERS DOING AT 0100? WHERE WERE\\nGOLCHER\\'S BODYGUARDS? WHERE WERE HIS COMPANION\\'S BODYGUARDS? THE TWO\\nMEN WERE PROBABLY RETURNING FROM A CORRUPTION CENTER, A NIGHT\\nCLUB--ONE OF THOSE EXCLUSIVE CLUBS WHERE THE U.S. ADVISERS AND OTHER\\nU.S. AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SPEND THE DOLLARS THEY STEAL\\nFROM THE FUNDS ALLOTTED TO EL SALVADOR AND WHERE THEY PLAN CRIMES\\nAGAINST THE PEOPLE.\\n\\n   MUCH MORE COULD BE SAID; HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INCIDENT\\nWAS NO MERE ACCIDENT. MRS PLATERO IS ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE MADNESS\\nAFFECTING AN ARMY DIRECTED BY U.S.  ADVISERS. THERE IS NOT MUCH\\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS INCIDENT AND THE HURLING OF A GRENADE BY A\\nSOLDIER DRIVEN CRAZY BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRORISM PRACTICED BY THE\\nARMY ADVISERS AND CHIEFS. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT GOLCHER\\nWILL NOT BE TRIED FOR THIS NEW CRIME, JUST AS HE HAS NOT BEEN TRIED\\nFOR THE MANY CRIMES HE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AS CHIEF OF THE\\nREPRESSIVE CORPS AND DEATH SQUADS.\\n\\n\\nTST4-MUC4-0006\\n\\n   SAN SALVADOR, 25 AUG 88 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [TEXT] A\\nCORPORAL AND A GUERRILLA HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE MOST RECENT CLASHES\\nBETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE FMLN.

THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE\\nOFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING.\\n\\n   WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM.\\nHOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYS\\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOT\\nNECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA\\nOF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFF\\nAN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA.\\n\\n   [REPORTER] GENERAL, THE FMLN\\'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SO\\nOVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAINING\\nCONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN\\'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN IT\\nIS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES?\\n\\n   [VIDES] WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANY\\nCIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY\\nVISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUP\\nMEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT AT\\nTHE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN\\nGOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVE\\nFAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR\\nLARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT AND\\nUSULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY.\\n\\n   THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS.  HOWEVER,\\nTHE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR\\nFIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORIST\\nACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERAL\\nUPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS.\\n\\n   THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOP\\nTHEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVE\\nFAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS.  THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMA\\nSHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT.\\n\\n   THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHT\\nNOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASS\\nA RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT.\\n\\n   FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC\\nPROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE\\nDEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS,\\nWHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.

THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER\\n\"ECONOMIC AGENTS\" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT.\\nTHE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE \"NOT HAVING TO COMPETE\\nWITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN\\nCIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH.

EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A\\nHIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT \"IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR\\nAN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO\\nBE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVY\\nCONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH.\"\\n\\n   ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT\\'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY\\nVISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT\\nTHE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE\\nIT.

AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO\\nSET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT\\nTHIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF\\nLIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE\\nSOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY.\\n\\n   PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29\\nOCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY,\\nIN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE\\nNUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST\\nGROUP.
